{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "Team A offers their top RB and a solid WR for an upgrade at WR and a slight downgrade at RB. This trade benefits Team A by significantly improving their WR corps with CeeDee Lamb, while maintaining strong RB depth. For Team B, they get a potential superstar RB in Bijan Robinson, addressing their need for a true RB1, and receive a promising young WR in Pickens. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both teams."}
