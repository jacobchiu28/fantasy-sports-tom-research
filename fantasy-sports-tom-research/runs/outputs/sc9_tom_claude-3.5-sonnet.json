{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Xavier Worthy", "Tyler Higbee"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Jaylen Waddle"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and WR for Team B's top RB and a solid WR. Achane significantly upgrades A's RB corps, while Waddle provides a consistent WR threat. B gains a starting RB in Mixon, a high-potential WR in Worthy, and improves at TE with Higbee. This trade balances both teams' rosters and addresses their respective needs."}
