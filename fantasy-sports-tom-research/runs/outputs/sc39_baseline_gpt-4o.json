{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering Baker Mayfield, who has a higher projection than any of Team B's QBs, and Michael Pittman Jr., a solid WR, in exchange for Ja'Marr Chase, an elite WR. This trade strengthens Team A's WR position significantly while providing Team B with a QB upgrade and a reliable WR."}
