{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Calvin Ridley"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite RB depth to acquire a top-tier WR, which is its biggest weakness. Team B has an excess of elite WRs and needs a high-end RB. This trade balances both rosters perfectly. Team A gets a true WR1 in Lamb while Team B gets an explosive RB1 in Achane. The inclusion of Ridley and Jones Sr. balances the projected value, making it a mutually beneficial deal that improves both starting lineups."}
