{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams", "Jerome Ford"], "ask_from_B": ["Garrett Wilson", "Evan Engram"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses our primary need for a reliable, top-tier TE by acquiring Evan Engram, a clear upgrade over our current options. We are offering Davante Adams, who would immediately become your undisputed WR1 and solve your biggest roster weakness. We are also including Jerome Ford from our deep running back corps to provide you with valuable depth. In return, taking on Garrett Wilson alongside Engram allows us to maintain a strong receiving corps. This is a mutually beneficial deal that improves the starting lineup for both teams by addressing each team's most significant area of need."}
