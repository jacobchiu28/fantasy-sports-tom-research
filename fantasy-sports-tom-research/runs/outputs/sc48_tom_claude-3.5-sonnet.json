{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Chris Olave"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Bijan Robinson (RB, 18.5) and Chris Olave (WR, 10.9) for CeeDee Lamb (WR, 17.4) and James Cook (RB, 14.2). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at WR with Lamb while maintaining RB depth with Cook. Team B gets a top RB in Robinson and a solid WR in Olave. Team B likely accepts as they improve their RB situation significantly while still having strong WR depth. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and addresses needs for both teams."}
