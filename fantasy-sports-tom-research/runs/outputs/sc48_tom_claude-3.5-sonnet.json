{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "DJ Moore", "Pat Freiermuth"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with McCaffrey while addressing Team B's WR depth need with Moore. Collins provides a strong WR option for Team A. Freiermuth helps Team B at TE. Team B improves WR depth and TE while still maintaining a strong RB corps. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional needs, making it appealing for both teams."}
