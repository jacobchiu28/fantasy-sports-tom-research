{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "David Montgomery"], "ask_from_B": ["Puka Nacua"], "rationale": "Team A offers a top-tier TE and a reliable RB2 to acquire an elite young WR. This move leverages Team A's incredible TE depth (still having McBride and Andrews) and solid RB room to bolster its starting WRs behind Chase and Lamb. Team B receives a significant TE upgrade and a dependable RB, strengthening two positions by trading from its deep WR corps."}
