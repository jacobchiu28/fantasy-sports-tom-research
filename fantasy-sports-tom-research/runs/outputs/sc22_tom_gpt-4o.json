{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane and Jaxon Smith-Njigba to Team B in exchange for Christian McCaffrey. Team A strengthens their RB position with McCaffrey, who has a high projection and can be a game-changer. Team B receives Achane, a high-potential RB, and Smith-Njigba, a promising WR, which addresses their need for depth in both positions. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B gets two young, high-upside players, while Team A consolidates their RB strength with a top-tier player."}
