{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Breece Hall (12.7 proj) over David Montgomery (11.5 proj) and gets a higher-ceiling WR in Drake London (15.2 proj) for Jerry Jeudy (12.4 proj). Team B gains depth at RB with Montgomery and improves WR consistency with Jeudy. The trade addresses Team A's need for a higher-upside RB and WR, while giving Team B a reliable RB2 and a steady WR option. The projected points are balanced, making it fair and appealing for both sides."}
