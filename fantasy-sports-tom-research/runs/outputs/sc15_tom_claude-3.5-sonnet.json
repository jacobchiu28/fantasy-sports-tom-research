{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Malik Nabers", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tee Higgins", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB and WR while maintaining strength at TE. Team B gains a promising young RB and WR with high upside, plus a solid TE. The projected points are similar, making it fair.
