{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Josh Reynolds"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Mike Evans"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Bijan Robinson (high-value RB) and Josh Reynolds (WR depth) for Kenneth Walker III and Mike Evans. This trade benefits both teams: A upgrades at WR with Evans while maintaining RB strength with Walker. B gets a top RB in Robinson to pair with Pollard and adds WR depth. The trade is balanced in projected points and addresses needs for both teams, making it likely for B to accept."}
