{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Rashid Shaheed"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A offers David Montgomery, a solid RB with a 11.5 projection, and Rashid Shaheed, a promising WR with a 9.8 projection, to Team B in exchange for Kyren Williams, a high-performing RB with a 15.2 projection. Team A aims to strengthen their RB position with a higher projected player, while Team B receives depth in both RB and WR positions, addressing their need for more reliable WR options and maintaining RB depth. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B gains a balanced roster with potential upside from Shaheed, and Team A upgrades their RB lineup."}
