{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Kenneth Walker III"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "Pat Freiermuth"], "reasoning": "Team A has an extraordinary surplus at TE with both McBride and Andrews, making one expendable to acquire a true superstar at a position of need. This trade lands Ja'Marr Chase, a top-3 league-wide WR, to be the cornerstone of Team A's receiving corps. For Team B, this deal converts their elite WR into a top-tier RB1 in Kenneth Walker III and a massive TE upgrade in Mark Andrews, strengthening two starting positions and giving them a significant positional advantage over most of the league at TE."}
