{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Drake London"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Allen"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A acquires an elite, top-tier QB in Josh Allen, which is its biggest position of weakness. While the cost is high, Team A trades from its deepest positions, RB and WR. The RB room remains strong with Christian McCaffrey, Isiah Pacheco, and Jaylen Warren, and the WR corps is still solid with Courtland Sutton and Jayden Reed. For Team B, this trade is a massive win. You have an incredible surplus at QB but a significant need at RB. This deal provides you with a legitimate RB1 in James Cook and a high-upside WR1 in Drake London, fundamentally improving two of your starting positions by trading a QB you don't need to start, given you also have Lamar Jackson."}
