{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Chris Olave"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Tyler Lockett to Team B in exchange for Kyren Williams and Chris Olave. Team A strengthens its RB position with Kyren Williams, who has a higher projection than Swift, and gains a solid WR in Olave to bolster their receiving corps. Team B receives Swift, who is a reliable RB, and Lockett, who can add depth to their WR lineup, addressing their need for more consistent WR options. This trade is mutually beneficial as it balances both teams' positional strengths and needs."}
