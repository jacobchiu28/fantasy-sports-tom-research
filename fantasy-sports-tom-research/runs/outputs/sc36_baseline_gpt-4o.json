{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Marquise Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Marquise Brown to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson. Swift and Brown have solid projections, but acquiring Robinson, who has a higher projection and is a top-tier RB, would significantly strengthen Team A's RB lineup. Team B might consider this trade to add depth to their WR position and maintain a strong RB lineup with other high-projection players like McCaffrey and Jacobs."}
