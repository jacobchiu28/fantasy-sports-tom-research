{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "DeVonta Smith", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Chris Olave"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by acquiring a higher-projected RB in Bijan Robinson (18.5) to replace Derrick Henry (16.2), while also upgrading at WR with Chris Olave (10.9) over DeVonta Smith (13.0). The slight downgrade in projected points for the WR is offset by the RB upgrade. Kyle Pitts Sr. is included to balance the trade, as Team A has depth at TE. This trade addresses Team A's need for a top RB while maintaining strength at WR and TE positions."}
