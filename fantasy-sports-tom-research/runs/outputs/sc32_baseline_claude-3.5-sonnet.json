{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Evan Engram", "Russell Wilson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts", "Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at QB with Hurts (22.0 proj) while addressing RB depth with Williams (15.2 proj). Team B gains a solid RB1 in Jacobs (15.5 proj), improves at TE with Engram (9.7 proj), and gets a serviceable QB replacement in Wilson (15.4 proj). This trade balances both teams' needs and projected points."}
