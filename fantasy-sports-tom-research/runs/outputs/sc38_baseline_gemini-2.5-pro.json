{"offer_from_A": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "Chuba Hubbard"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses our biggest weakness (RB) by acquiring an elite talent in Bijan Robinson, while you acquire a true alpha WR1 in Ja'Marr Chase to lead your receiving corps. It's a classic strength-for-strength swap; we move a top WR from our deep roster and you move a top RB from your deep backfield. We both get a star at a position of need and the projections are nearly identical, making it a perfectly balanced deal that improves both rosters."}
