{"offer_from_A": ["Tee Higgins", "Brock Purdy"], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook", "C.J. Stroud"], "rationale": "Team A gets a high-end RB1 in James Cook by trading from its deep QB and WR positions. Team B addresses its biggest need by acquiring an elite WR2 in Tee Higgins and also gets a slight upgrade at their backup QB spot with Brock Purdy. This is a mutually beneficial trade from positions of strength for both teams."}
