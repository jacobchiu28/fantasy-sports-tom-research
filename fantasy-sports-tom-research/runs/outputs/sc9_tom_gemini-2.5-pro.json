{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tua Tagovailoa"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "This trade is a win-win addressing each team's primary needs. Team A acquires an elite, top-tier QB in Lamar Jackson, significantly raising its weekly ceiling, and receives a strong RB1 in James Cook to replace the outgoing production. Team B consolidates its massive QB surplus, turning an elite QB they can't start into a true superstar RB1 in Bijan Robinson, which is their biggest roster weakness. They still retain two elite QBs (Burrow, Daniels) and get a very capable QB in Tua for depth or future trades."}
