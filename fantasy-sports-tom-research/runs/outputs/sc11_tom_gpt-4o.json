{"offer_from_A": ["Brian Robinson Jr.", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Brian Robinson Jr. and Jaylen Waddle to Team B in exchange for Jahmyr Gibbs. Team A strengthens their RB position with a high-projection player, addressing the need for a more reliable RB2 behind Saquon Barkley. Team B receives a solid RB in Brian Robinson Jr. and a strong WR in Jaylen Waddle, enhancing their WR depth and maintaining RB depth, making the trade appealing for both teams."}
