{"offer_from_A": ["Kyler Murray"], "ask_from_B": ["DK Metcalf", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its significant QB depth to address its primary need for a reliable starting WR and improved RB depth. Kyler Murray provides Team B with a weekly top-5 QB, a major upgrade over their current options. In return, Team A acquires DK Metcalf as a strong WR2 and Rhamondre Stevenson, a solid starting RB. Team B can easily accommodate this trade by dealing from its deep pool of running backs, making it a mutually beneficial deal that strengthens both starting lineups."}
