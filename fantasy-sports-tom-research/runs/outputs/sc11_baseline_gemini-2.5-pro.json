{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["Brian Thomas Jr.", "Rachaad White"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A has elite TE depth with Kittle and Andrews and is trading from that strength, along with RB depth in James Cook, to acquire a high-upside WR in Brian Thomas Jr. to pair with Tyreek Hill. Team B is weak at TE and lacks RB depth behind its starters; this deal provides a massive upgrade at TE with Mark Andrews and a solid RB2 in James Cook, strengthening their starting lineup significantly by parting with a WR from their deepest position group."}
