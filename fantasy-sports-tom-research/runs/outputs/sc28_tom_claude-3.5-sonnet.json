{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Cooper Kupp", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with McCaffrey, a top-tier player, and improves at TE with Andrews. Team B gains depth at RB with Henry, upgrades at WR with Kupp, and gets a high-potential TE in Pitts. Team B likely accepts due to receiving three solid players for two, addressing multiple positions while maintaining RB strength."}
