{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Jameson Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["Calvin Ridley", "Isiah Pacheco"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane (RB, 17.1) and Jameson Williams (WR, 12.6) for Calvin Ridley (WR, 11.8) and Isiah Pacheco (RB, 11.5). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Ridley, a more consistent performer than Williams, while maintaining RB depth with Pacheco. Team B gains a high-upside RB in Achane and a potential breakout WR in Williams, addressing their need for explosive playmakers. The projected points are balanced, making it fair and appealing for both sides."}
