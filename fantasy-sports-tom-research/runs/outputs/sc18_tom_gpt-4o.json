{"offer_from_A": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaxon Smith-Njigba, a high-potential WR, and Brian Robinson Jr., a solid RB, to Team B in exchange for Jahmyr Gibbs, an elite RB. Team B has a strong WR lineup with Justin Jefferson and DJ Moore, making Smith-Njigba a valuable depth addition. Robinson Jr. provides a reliable RB option, addressing Team B's need for RB depth behind Gibbs. Team A strengthens its RB position with Gibbs, who has a higher projection than any of their current RBs, while Team B gains depth and potential at WR and RB, making the trade mutually beneficial."}
