{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Kenneth Walker III"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial. Team A consolidates assets from positions of strength (TE and RB depth) to acquire a true superstar WR1 in Ja'Marr Chase, which is its biggest need. Team B addresses its glaring TE weakness by acquiring an elite TE in Mark Andrews and adds a strong RB1 in Kenneth Walker III, significantly improving their roster's overall balance and depth by turning one superstar into two high-quality weekly starters."}
