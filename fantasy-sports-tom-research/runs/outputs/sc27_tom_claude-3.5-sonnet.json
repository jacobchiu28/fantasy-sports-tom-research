{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Terry McLaurin", "Noah Gray"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and a solid WR2 for an elite WR1 and upgrade at TE. Team B gains a strong RB1 in Jacobs, addressing their RB weakness, while McLaurin provides WR depth. Gray offsets the loss of McBride. Team B likely accepts due to significant RB improvement and maintaining WR strength."}
