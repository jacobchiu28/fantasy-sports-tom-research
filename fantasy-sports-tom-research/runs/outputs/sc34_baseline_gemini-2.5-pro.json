{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Bucky Irving"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "DJ Moore"], "reasoning": "This is a win-win consolidation trade. Team A leverages its elite QB surplus (Justin Herbert) and a high-upside rookie RB (Bucky Irving) to acquire an elite RB1 (Bijan Robinson) and a WR1 (DJ Moore). Team B solves its QB depth issue by acquiring a top QB, trading from its incredibly deep pool of running backs."}
