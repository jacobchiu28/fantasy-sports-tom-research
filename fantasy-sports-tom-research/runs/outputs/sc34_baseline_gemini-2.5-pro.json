{"offer_from_A": ["Breece Hall", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "reasoning": "Team A has extensive RB depth (Irving, Pollard, Warren, Dobbins) and can afford to trade a top asset like Breece Hall to upgrade at WR. This deal swaps Jaylen Waddle (11.7 proj) for Nico Collins (15.9 proj), providing a significant boost to Team A's starting lineup. The minor RB downgrade from Hall to Stevenson is easily absorbed. Team B addresses its primary need for a reliable RB2 by upgrading from Stevenson to Hall. They trade from a position of immense WR strength (Chase, Brian Thomas Jr., Evans) and receive a top-tier replacement in Waddle, strengthening their RB room without significantly weakening their WRs."}
