{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Tony Pollard"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A leverages its RB depth and elite TE to acquire a top-tier WR1 in CeeDee Lamb, forming a dominant duo with Tyreek Hill. Team B is very weak at TE and receives a massive upgrade with Trey McBride, while also upgrading from Tony Pollard to a workhorse RB1 in Derrick Henry. Team B's WR corps remains strong with Nabers and Collins, and Team A's RB room remains elite with Gibbs and Kyren Williams. It's a mutually beneficial deal that improves both starting lineups."}
