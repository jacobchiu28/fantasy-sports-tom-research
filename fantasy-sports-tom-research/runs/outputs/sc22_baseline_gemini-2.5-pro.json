{"offer_from_A": ["Dak Prescott"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its significant QB depth to address its primary need for a high-end WR. Team B has strong WR depth but is vulnerable behind Patrick Mahomes II; this trade provides them with an elite QB2 for insurance and bye week coverage in exchange for a WR2 that significantly upgrades Team A's starting lineup."}
