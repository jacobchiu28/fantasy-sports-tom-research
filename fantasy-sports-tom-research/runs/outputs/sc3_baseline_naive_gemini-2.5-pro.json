{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Purdy", "Chris Godwin", "Najee Harris"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Brock Bowers"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's projected points by acquiring elite, high-projection starters at the weakest positions (WR and TE) in Justin Jefferson and Brock Bowers. This is achieved by leveraging Team A's significant QB depth by trading Brock Purdy and selling low-projection players like Chris Godwin and Najee Harris, resulting in a net increase to the starting lineup's weekly output."}
