{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "Austin Ekeler"], "ask_from_B": ["Puka Nacua", "Bucky Irving"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its historic TE depth to acquire a foundational young WR in Puka Nacua and a high-upside RB in Bucky Irving. This move consolidates surplus talent into elite starters. Team B addresses its need for a proven, top-tier TE in George Kittle, pairing him with Lamar Jackson, while only parting with an RB from a position of depth."}
