{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Tyler Lockett", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with CMC while addressing Team B's depth needs. Team B gains a solid RB2 in Etienne, WR depth with Lockett, and TE1 potential in Waller. McBride's inclusion balances the trade, giving Team A a high-upside TE. This trade fills positional needs for both teams and offers fair value, making it appealing for Team B to accept."}
