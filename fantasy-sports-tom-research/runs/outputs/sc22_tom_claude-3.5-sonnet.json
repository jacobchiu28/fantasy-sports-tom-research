{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher upside than Henry, and gets a solid WR in Ridley to replace Pittman. Team B gets a reliable RB1 in Henry and improves their WR depth with Pittman. B likely accepts as they maintain RB strength while addressing WR needs."}
