{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "This is a classic strength-for-strength trade that addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A has an incredible surplus of high-end RBs (Gibbs, Taylor, Cook, Walker, Etienne) but is desperately weak at WR after Davante Adams. Team B is stacked at WR (Hill, Higgins, Diggs) and can afford to move one to create a dominant RB duo with Bijan Robinson. Team A solves its biggest roster hole by acquiring a legitimate WR1/2 in Tee Higgins, while Team B receives a top-tier RB in Jonathan Taylor, giving them a formidable backfield and a net gain in weekly projected points, making the deal highly appealing."}
