{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Michael Wilson"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Walker III (13.7 proj) over Etienne (10.0 proj), while Team B gains a strong WR in Pickens (12.1 proj) to bolster their receiving corps. Walker III fits better in Team A's RB-heavy roster, while Pickens addresses Team B's need for WR depth. Etienne provides Team B with a solid RB option, and Wilson (6.9 proj) is a minor downgrade for Team A at WR. This trade balances both teams' needs and projections, making it mutually beneficial and likely to be accepted."}
