{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "DeVonta Smith"], "ask_from_B": ["Joe Burrow", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Josh Jacobs (RB) and DeVonta Smith (WR) for Joe Burrow (QB) and D'Andre Swift (RB). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at QB with Burrow, addressing their need for a top-tier QB. They can afford to trade Jacobs due to RB depth. Team B gains a strong RB1 in Jacobs and improves their WR corps with Smith. B can spare Burrow due to having Jalen Hurts. The trade is balanced in projected points and addresses needs for both teams, making it likely for B to accept."}
