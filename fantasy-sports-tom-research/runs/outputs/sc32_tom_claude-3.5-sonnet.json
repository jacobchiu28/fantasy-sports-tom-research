{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "DeVonta Smith"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry (RB) and DeVonta Smith (WR) for Bijan Robinson (RB). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at RB with a younger, higher-projected player in Robinson (18.5) compared to Henry (16.2). Team B gains a solid RB in Henry and improves their WR depth with Smith (13.0), addressing their weaker WR corps. Team B likely accepts as they maintain RB strength while significantly upgrading at WR, balancing their roster."}
