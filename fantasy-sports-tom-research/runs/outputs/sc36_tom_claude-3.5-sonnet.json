{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane (RB, 17.1 proj) and Tyler Lockett (WR, 6.0 proj) for Saquon Barkley (RB, 19.3 proj). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at RB with a star player, while Team B gains depth with a solid RB and WR. Team B likely accepts as they're getting two starters for one, addressing their WR depth need. The trade is fair in projected points and positional value."}
