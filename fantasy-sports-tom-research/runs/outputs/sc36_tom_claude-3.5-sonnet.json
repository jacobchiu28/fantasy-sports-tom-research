{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Drake London", "Cole Kmet"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Greg Dortch"], "reasoning": "Team A offers a package to upgrade Team B's WR and TE positions while still receiving a top RB. Swift (11.4) is productive but Robinson (18.5) is an upgrade. London (15.2) significantly improves Team B's WR corps, and Kmet (3.9) provides TE depth. Team B can afford to trade Robinson due to depth at RB (McCaffrey, Jacobs). Team A improves at RB while maintaining WR strength. The trade addresses needs for both teams and offers fair value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
