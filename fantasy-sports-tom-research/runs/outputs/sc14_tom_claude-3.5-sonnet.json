{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Xavier Worthy"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry (RB) and Xavier Worthy (WR) for Christian McCaffrey (RB). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at RB with McCaffrey's higher projection (18.6 vs Henry's 16.2) while maintaining WR depth. Team B gains a solid RB in Henry plus a high-potential WR in Worthy (14.9 proj), addressing their WR weakness. B likely accepts as they improve WR significantly while maintaining RB strength with Henry. Trade is fair, balancing positional needs and overall value."}
