{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Mike Evans", "Cole Kmet"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A improves at RB with Jacobs (15.5 proj) over Montgomery (11.5 proj), while maintaining WR strength by swapping Evans (14.6 proj) for Higgins (14.4 proj). Team B gains depth at RB and WR, plus upgrades TE with Kmet. This trade balances both teams' needs and projections, making it mutually beneficial and likely to be accepted."}
