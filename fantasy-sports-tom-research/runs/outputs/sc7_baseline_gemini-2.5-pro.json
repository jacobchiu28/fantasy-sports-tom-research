{"offer_from_A": ["DJ Moore", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Colston Loveland"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses the primary needs for both teams. Team A significantly upgrades at two positions, acquiring an elite, high-upside RB in De'Von Achane to create a dominant duo with Christian McCaffrey, and adding Colston Loveland to solve a major weakness at tight end. Team A can afford to move DJ Moore due to strong depth with Amon-Ra St. Brown, Brian Thomas Jr., and others. Team B fixes its biggest roster hole by acquiring a true WR1 in DJ Moore. They trade from their incredible RB depth (still having Bijan Robinson and Travis Etienne Jr.) to fill their most pressing need, and receive a solid RB in Javonte Williams to maintain depth."}
