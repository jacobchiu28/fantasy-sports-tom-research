{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to address its two biggest weaknesses: a top-tier WR and a starting TE. This trade provides Team B with a massive upgrade at QB in Jalen Hurts, addressing their primary need. Team B can afford to part with Collins and Kittle due to their incredible depth with Ja'Marr Chase and Mark Andrews. Javonte Williams is included to balance the trade and bolster Team B's already strong RB corps."}
