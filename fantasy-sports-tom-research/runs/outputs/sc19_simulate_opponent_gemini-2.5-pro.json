{"offer_from_A": ["DeVonta Smith", "J.K. Dobbins"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "DeMario Douglas"], "rationale": "This trade addresses primary needs for both teams. Team A acquires a true RB1 in Kyren Williams by trading from its deep WR position. Team B gets a major upgrade at WR with DeVonta Smith, its weakest position, while receiving a solid RB2 in Dobbins to maintain depth after moving Williams."}
