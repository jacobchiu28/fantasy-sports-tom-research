{"offer_from_A": ["Dalton Kincaid", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Tony Pollard", "Garrett Wilson"], "rationale": "This is a balanced trade addressing both teams' needs. Team A acquires a much-needed starting RB in Pollard while still maintaining elite WR depth. Team B significantly upgrades its TE position with Kincaid and receives a top-tier WR in Higgins, dealing from its position of RB strength."}
