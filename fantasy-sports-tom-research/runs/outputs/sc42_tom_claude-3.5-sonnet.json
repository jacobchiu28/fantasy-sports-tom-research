{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Jefferson (18.4 proj) while maintaining RB strength with Gibbs (17.9 proj). Team B gains a top RB in Robinson (18.5 proj) and a solid WR in Kupp (11.1 proj). Team B addresses RB depth concerns, while Team A improves WR corps. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both sides."}
