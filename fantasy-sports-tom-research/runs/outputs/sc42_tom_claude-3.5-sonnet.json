{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "George Pickens", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB, WR, and TE for Team B's star RB and WR. Swift provides a solid RB2, Pickens offers WR upside, and Pitts adds TE depth. Team B gains positional flexibility while Team A upgrades at RB and WR. The trade balances immediate value and potential, addressing needs for both teams."}
