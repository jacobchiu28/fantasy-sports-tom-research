{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Nico Collins", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher projection than Stevenson, and gets an elite WR in Chase. Team B gains depth with three solid players: Stevenson (RB), Collins (WR), and Andrews (TE). Andrews is an upgrade at TE for Team B. The trade is balanced in terms of overall projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both sides."}
