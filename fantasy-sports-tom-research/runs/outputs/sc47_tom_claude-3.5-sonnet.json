{"offer_from_A": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Garrett Wilson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Mike Evans"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has a higher projection than Gibbs. Evans provides a consistent WR option to replace Wilson. For Team B, they get a young, high-upside RB in Gibbs and a potential WR1 in Wilson, both with strong projections. This trade balances immediate production with future potential, making it attractive for both sides."}
