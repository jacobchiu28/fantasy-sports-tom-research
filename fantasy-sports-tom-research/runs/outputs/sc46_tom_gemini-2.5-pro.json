{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "DK Metcalf"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as it addresses primary roster needs by leveraging positional strengths. Team A acquires Tyreek Hill, the elite WR1 it desperately needs, by packaging a strong RB and WR. Team B, which has an extreme surplus of quality RBs (Gibbs, Jacobs, Montgomery, Mixon), converts that depth by trading Swift and Hill to acquire DK Metcalf, who immediately solves their significant lack of WR depth behind their top two. Team B also gets a comparable high-end RB in Kamara, making this a balanced deal that strengthens both rosters where they are weakest."}
