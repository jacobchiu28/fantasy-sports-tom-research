{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Cooper Kupp", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth for top-tier talent. Barkley (19.3) is a significant upgrade over Stevenson (10.3) at RB. Collins (15.9) replaces Kupp (11.1) with higher projection. Andrews (10.8) is expendable with Kittle (13.2) on roster. This trade improves Team A's starting lineup while leveraging depth."}
