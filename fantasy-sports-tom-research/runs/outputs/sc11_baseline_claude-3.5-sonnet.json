{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "DeVonta Smith", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Terry McLaurin", "Travis Kelce"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall projected points. Gibbs (17.9) is a slight downgrade from Barkley (19.3), but McLaurin (14.3) and Kelce (11.0) offer higher projections than Smith (13.0) and Hockenson (10.7). The trade addresses Team A's need for consistent WR production and upgrades the TE position with Kelce, while maintaining strong RB performance."}
