{"offer_from_A": ["Mike Evans", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Tyler Higbee"], "rationale": "Team A gets the elite RB1 it desperately needs in Derrick Henry by trading from its WR and TE depth. Team B consolidates its incredible RB depth to acquire a true top-tier TE in T.J. Hockenson, a major position of need, and adds another stud WR in Mike Evans."}
