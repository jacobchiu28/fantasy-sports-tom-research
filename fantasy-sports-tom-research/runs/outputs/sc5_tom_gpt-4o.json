{"offer_from_A": ["Najee Harris", "DK Metcalf"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Chris Godwin"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Najee Harris and DK Metcalf to Team B in exchange for Jahmyr Gibbs and Chris Godwin. Team A aims to strengthen its RB position with Gibbs, who has a higher projection than Harris, and adds depth to WR with Godwin. Team B receives Metcalf, a high-projection WR, addressing their need for a strong WR alongside CeeDee Lamb, and Harris, who provides depth at RB. This trade is mutually beneficial as it balances both teams' positional strengths and needs."}
