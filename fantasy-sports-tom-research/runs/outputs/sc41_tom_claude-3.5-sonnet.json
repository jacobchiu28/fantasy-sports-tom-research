{"offer_from_A": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Calvin Ridley", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Austin Ekeler", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Jefferson, while maintaining RB depth with Ekeler and improving at TE with Goedert. Team B gets the top RB in McCaffrey, a solid WR2 in Ridley, and a high-potential TE in Pitts. Team B likely accepts due to McCaffrey's elite status and their need for RB improvement."}
