{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and WR for CMC's elite production. Team B gains a solid RB1 in Jacobs and a high-upside WR2 in Waddle, addressing their WR depth issues. Team A consolidates talent, while Team B improves overall roster balance. Fair value exchange makes it appealing for both sides."}
