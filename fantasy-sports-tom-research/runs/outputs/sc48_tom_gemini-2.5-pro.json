{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Chuba Hubbard"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "Austin Ekeler"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial. Team A acquires a high-end WR2 in Tee Higgins to address its primary need, trading from positions of strength at QB and RB. Team B solidifies its volatile QB room with a consistent top-8 option in Justin Herbert and gets a reliable starting RB in Hubbard, while only having to part with a WR from its incredibly deep receiver corps and an aging RB in Austin Ekeler."}
