{"offer_from_A": ["Bucky Irving", "Marvin Harrison Jr.", "Justin Herbert"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Saquon Barkley"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall strength. We're offering a high-scoring RB (Irving), a promising WR (Harrison Jr.), and a top QB (Herbert) for the elite WR Jefferson and RB Barkley. Jefferson is a significant upgrade at WR, while Barkley provides a consistent, high-scoring RB option. Team A can afford to trade Herbert due to depth at QB. This trade balances both teams' needs and improves Team A's weekly scoring potential."}
