{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Curtis Samuel", "Cade Otton"], "ask_from_B": ["Isiah Pacheco", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade Chubb. Pacheco offers similar projection with more upside. Ridley is an upgrade over Samuel at WR. Otton is expendable with LaPorta as TE1. This trade improves Team A's starting lineup while maintaining depth."}
