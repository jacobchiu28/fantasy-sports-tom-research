{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams", "James Conner"], "rationale": "This trade addresses the biggest needs for both teams. Team A acquires a true WR1 in Davante Adams by leveraging its QB depth, and gets a comparable RB1 back. Team B solves its RB problem with a solid starter in Pollard and lands an elite, proven QB in Herbert by trading from its area of greatest strength, wide receiver."}
