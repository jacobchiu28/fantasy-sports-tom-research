{"offer_from_A": ["Trey McBride", "Tyler Allgeier"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for a top-tier RB by acquiring an elite workhorse in Saquon Barkley. In return, Team B receives a significant upgrade at their weakest starting position with a top-3 TE in Trey McBride and also bolsters their RB depth with Tyler Allgeier. The deal allows Team A to consolidate its TE strength into a dominant RB, creating a more balanced championship contender."}
