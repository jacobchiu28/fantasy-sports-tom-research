{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "Team A possesses an extraordinary surplus of starting running backs but lacks a true second elite wide receiver to complement Ja'Marr Chase. This trade consolidates that RB depth into a top-tier WR asset. Team B is exceptionally weak at running back and this trade immediately provides them with two high-volume starters in Josh Jacobs and James Cook, fundamentally fixing their biggest roster deficiency. While losing CeeDee Lamb is significant, Team B retains a strong receiving corps with Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chris Olave, making this a win-win trade that balances both rosters."}
