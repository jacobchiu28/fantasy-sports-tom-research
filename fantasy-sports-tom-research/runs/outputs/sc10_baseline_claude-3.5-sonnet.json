{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Terry McLaurin", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Cooper Kupp", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall talent and projected points. We upgrade at RB with Taylor (16.2) over Jones (11.5), get a high-upside WR in Kupp (11.1) to replace McLaurin (14.3), and significantly upgrade at TE with McBride (14.6) over Goedert (9.2). The trade balances positional needs and provides upside for both teams."}
