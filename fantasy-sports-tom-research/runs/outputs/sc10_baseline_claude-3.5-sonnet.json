{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Brian Thomas Jr.", "Hunter Henry"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by upgrading at RB with Barkley (19.3 proj vs Henry's 16.2). We maintain WR strength by swapping St. Brown (16.9) for Thomas Jr. (16.0), and slightly upgrade at TE with Henry (8.3) over Schultz (7.0). Team B gets a solid RB1 in Henry, an elite WR1 in St. Brown, and depth at TE. The trade is balanced and mutually beneficial."}
