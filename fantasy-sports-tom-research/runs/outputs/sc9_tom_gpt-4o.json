{"offer_from_A": ["Chase Brown", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Chase Brown and George Pickens to Team B in exchange for James Cook. Team A strengthens their RB position with a high-projection player, James Cook, addressing their need for a more reliable RB option. Team B receives Chase Brown, a solid RB, and George Pickens, a promising WR, which enhances their WR depth and compensates for the loss of Cook. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B has a surplus of RBs and can afford to trade Cook while improving their WR lineup."}
