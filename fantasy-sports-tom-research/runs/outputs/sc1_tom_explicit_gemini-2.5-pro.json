{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers", "Tyjae Spears"], "rationale": "Team A addresses its need for a high-upside WR1 and RB depth by trading from its QB and TE surplus. Team B receives a massive upgrade at its two weakest positions, acquiring an elite QB in Joe Burrow and a top-tier TE in George Kittle, which significantly strengthens their starting lineup."}
