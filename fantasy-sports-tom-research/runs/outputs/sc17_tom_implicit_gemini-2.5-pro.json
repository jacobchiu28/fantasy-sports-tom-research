{"offer_from_A": ["Kyren Williams", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Tetairoa McMillan"], "rationale": "This trade addresses clear needs for both teams. You get a significant upgrade at TE with Goedert and an elite RB1 in Kyren Williams to pair with Bijan, solving your RB depth issues. I get a much-needed WR1 in McMillan and a strong RB2 in Breece Hall to balance my roster. It's a mutually beneficial deal that strengthens both our starting lineups."}
