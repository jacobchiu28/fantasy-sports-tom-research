{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB position with a more consistent performer. Offering J.K. Dobbins, who has a decent projection but is injury-prone, and Dalton Schultz, a backup TE, for James Conner, who has a higher projection and is a more reliable RB option, aligns with this goal. Team B might accept this trade to gain depth at TE and a potential high-upside RB."}
