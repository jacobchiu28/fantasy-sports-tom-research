{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Zay Flowers", "Patrick Mahomes II"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Josh Jacobs", "Brock Purdy"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We upgrade at WR with Jefferson, maintain RB production with Jacobs, and only slightly downgrade at QB with Purdy. Team B gets a top RB in Henry, a solid WR in Flowers, and an elite QB in Mahomes, addressing their needs across positions."}
