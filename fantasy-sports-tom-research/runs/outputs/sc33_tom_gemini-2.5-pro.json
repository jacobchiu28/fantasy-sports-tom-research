{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["Brock Bowers", "Breece Hall"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A has a surplus of quality QBs and a major weakness at TE. Team B has a major weakness at QB and a surplus at TE with both Bowers and Goedert. Team A sends the elite QB Lamar Jackson, providing Team B a massive, league-winning upgrade over their current options. In return, Team A gets the elite TE Brock Bowers, solving their biggest roster hole. To balance the deal, depth RB Javonte Williams is swapped for Breece Hall. Team B is likely to accept as they acquire a top-tier QB, which is their greatest need, while only giving up a TE from a position of strength (they still have Dallas Goedert) and swapping RBs."}
