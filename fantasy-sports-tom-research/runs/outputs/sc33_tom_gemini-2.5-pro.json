{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Rome Odunze"], "reasoning": "Team A has elite RB depth with Bijan Robinson, Jaylen Warren, and D'Andre Swift, but lacks a strong WR2 after DK Metcalf. Team B has exceptional WR depth with Amon-Ra St. Brown, Chris Olave, and Jakobi Meyers, making the promising but unproven rookie Rome Odunze expendable. This trade allows Team A to acquire a high-upside WR2 to address its biggest need by dealing from a position of strength. For Team B, it converts a rookie WR into a proven, veteran RB in Aaron Jones Sr., giving them unparalleled and injury-proof depth behind Saquon Barkley, Josh Jacobs, and Kyren Williams. The nearly identical projections make this a fair value swap that improves both rosters by balancing their positional strengths."}
