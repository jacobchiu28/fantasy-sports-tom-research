{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Courtland Sutton", "Pat Freiermuth"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "Team A improves WR depth with St. Brown, upgrades TE with Goedert. Team B gains a strong RB in Jacobs (addressing RB weakness), a solid WR2 in Sutton, and TE depth with Freiermuth. Fair value exchange addressing needs for both teams."}
