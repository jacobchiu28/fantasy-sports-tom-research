{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Trey McBride", "Baker Mayfield"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB, a high-scoring TE, and a top QB for Barkley (upgrade over Ekeler) and Andrews (slight downgrade from McBride, but still elite). Team B improves QB situation significantly with Mayfield, gets a solid RB1 replacement, and upgrades TE. Fair value exchange addressing needs for both teams."}
