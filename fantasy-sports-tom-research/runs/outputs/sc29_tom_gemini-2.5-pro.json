{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert"], "ask_from_B": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its significant QB depth to acquire a needed high-upside WR1 in Jaxon Smith-Njigba and a solid starting RB in Brian Robinson Jr., instantly improving its starting lineup. Team B accepts this trade because it consolidates two of its depth pieces at its strongest position (WR) and a mid-tier RB for an elite QB in Justin Herbert, giving them an unprecedented trio of QBs (Hurts, Allen, Herbert) which provides a massive advantage and injury insulation in a superflex format."}
