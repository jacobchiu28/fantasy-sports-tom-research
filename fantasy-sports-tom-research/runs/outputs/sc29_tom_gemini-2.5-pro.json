{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts"], "ask_from_B": ["Joe Burrow", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic strength-for-need swap. Team A has an unparalleled surplus of top-tier QBs and a significant need for a reliable WR2. By trading Jalen Hurts, they still retain two excellent starters in Stroud and Herbert, while swapping for another elite QB in Joe Burrow and acquiring Calvin Ridley to solidify their WR corps. For Team B, this is a chance to upgrade to a top-3 fantasy QB in Jalen Hurts, whose rushing upside provides a massive weekly advantage. While giving up Burrow and Ridley is significant, the upgrade at the QB position is substantial, and they have enough WR depth with players like Tetairoa McMillan to absorb the loss. Team B gets the best player in the deal, and Team A balances its roster perfectly."}
