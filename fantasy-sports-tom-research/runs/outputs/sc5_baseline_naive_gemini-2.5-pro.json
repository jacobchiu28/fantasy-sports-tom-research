{"offer_from_A": ["Sam LaPorta", "Chase Brown", "Zay Flowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Brian Thomas Jr.", "Josh Jacobs"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's total projected points by acquiring three elite, high-projection players for key starting positions. The deal results in a net gain of 10.4 projected points (50.1 acquired vs 39.7 offered), massively upgrading the RB and WR corps. Team A leverages its TE depth (Kincaid, Kraft) to part with LaPorta and still be competitive at the position, while the incoming talent creates an unparalleled starting lineup."}
