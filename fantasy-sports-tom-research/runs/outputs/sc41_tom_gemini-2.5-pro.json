{"offer_from_A": ["Nico Collins", "Jerome Ford"], "ask_from_B": ["Garrett Wilson", "Evan Engram"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as it addresses the primary needs of both teams. Team A has exceptional depth at WR and RB but is significantly weak at TE. Team B is desperate for a true WR1 but has a quality starting TE and a decent WR2. Team A receives a major upgrade at their weakest position with Evan Engram and a comparable WR2 in Garrett Wilson. They can afford to send Nico Collins and a bench RB like Jerome Ford because of their elite talent at those positions (Justin Jefferson, Jahmyr Gibbs, etc.). For Team B, this is a huge win. They acquire a legitimate WR1 in Nico Collins, who immediately becomes their best receiver by a large margin, fixing their most glaring roster hole. They sacrifice their TE but have viable replacements (Pat Freiermuth), making it a worthwhile cost to acquire a top-tier WR and additional RB depth in Ford. The deal makes both starting lineups stronger and more balanced."}
