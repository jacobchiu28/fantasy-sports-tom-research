{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "James Conner"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's most significant roster imbalance. Team A leverages its elite RB depth to acquire the true WR1 it desperately needs in CeeDee Lamb. Team B fixes its primary weakness at RB by adding two legitimate, high-volume starters in Achane and Conner, making this move from a position of extreme WR surplus (still rostering Jefferson, Hill, and McLaurin). The trade provides Team B with a much more balanced and competitive starting lineup."}
