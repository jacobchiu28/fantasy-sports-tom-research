{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tyler Lockett", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Joe Mixon"], "reasoning": "We're offering depth at RB, WR, and TE for a star WR and solid RB. Ekeler's projection is low, but his name value is high. Jefferson is a massive upgrade at WR, while Mixon provides RB depth. We can afford to lose Kittle with Bowers performing well."}
