{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Drake London", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "A.J. Brown"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by acquiring a top-tier RB in Saquon Barkley and an elite WR in A.J. Brown. We're offering James Cook (solid RB), Drake London (good WR), and George Kittle (top TE) to balance the trade. Team A can afford to part with Kittle due to having Andrews and Hockenson. This trade addresses Team A's need for a star RB while upgrading at WR, leveraging depth to acquire top-end talent."}
