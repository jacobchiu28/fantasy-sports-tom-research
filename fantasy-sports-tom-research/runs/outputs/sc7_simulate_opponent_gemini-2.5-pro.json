{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Chuba Hubbard"], "rationale": "This is a classic win-win trade addressing both teams' primary needs. Team B receives a significant upgrade at Tight End, swapping out an RB2 for an elite, top-tier TE in George Kittle, creating a major weekly positional advantage. Team A gets a much-needed reliable starting RB in Chuba Hubbard, trading from its TE depth to fill its biggest roster weakness."}
