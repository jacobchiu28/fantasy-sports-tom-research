{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "rationale": "You have a major need at TE and this trade provides you with an elite, durable option in George Kittle, plus a slight upgrade at RB with D'Andre Swift. My team has a surplus at TE, and this allows me to acquire a high-end WR2 in Tee Higgins, which is my biggest need, while getting a solid RB back in Stevenson. This is a classic strength-for-strength trade that improves both of our starting lineups."}
