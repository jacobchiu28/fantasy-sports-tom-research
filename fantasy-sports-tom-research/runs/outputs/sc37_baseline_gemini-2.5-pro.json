{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Purdy", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Davante Adams"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses Team A's need for a top-tier RB by leveraging its QB depth, while also providing a slight WR upgrade. For Team B, it provides a significant upgrade at QB2 and a reliable WR2 in Kupp, addressing their main roster weaknesses by trading from their deep pool of starting running backs, making it a mutually beneficial deal."}
