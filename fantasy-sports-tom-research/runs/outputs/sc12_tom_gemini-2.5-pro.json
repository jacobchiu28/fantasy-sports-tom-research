{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Terry McLaurin", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as it addresses each team's primary needs by trading from positions of surplus. Team A has an abundance of high-end RBs and TEs but lacks WR depth behind A.J. Brown. This move lands a top-tier WR2 in Terry McLaurin while swapping a surplus RB (Kamara for Swift) and an excess TE (Njoku). Team A's starting lineup significantly improves. Team B's roster is weakest at RB and TE. They receive a clear RB upgrade in Alvin Kamara over D'Andre Swift and a TE upgrade in David Njoku over their current options. By sacrificing one WR, Team B strengthens two positions of need, creating a more balanced and competitive roster."}
