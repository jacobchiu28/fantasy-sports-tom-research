{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial, addressing each team's primary needs. Team A has a surplus of elite RBs and TEs but lacks a top-tier WR. By trading Derrick Henry and the excellent but redundant Mark Andrews (behind Trey McBride), Team A acquires a true WR1 in Davante Adams, solving their biggest roster weakness, and gets a solid RB in Rhamondre Stevenson to maintain depth. Team B is weak at RB and TE. They receive a workhorse RB1 in Henry and an elite TE in Andrews, massively upgrading two starting positions. They can afford to part with Adams, given their WR depth with Odunze and Golden, and Stevenson is a clear downgrade from Henry, making this a significant win for their roster construction."}
