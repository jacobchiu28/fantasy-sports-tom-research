{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial blockbuster. Team A leverages its elite TE depth (still having LaPorta and Goedert) and a veteran WR to acquire a cornerstone RB in Breece Hall and a young stud WR in Drake London. Team B instantly solves its two biggest weaknesses, acquiring a top-tier TE in Kittle (a massive upgrade) and a proven WR1 in Adams. Team B can afford to move an RB due to its depth and this trade makes their starting lineup significantly more competitive immediately."}
