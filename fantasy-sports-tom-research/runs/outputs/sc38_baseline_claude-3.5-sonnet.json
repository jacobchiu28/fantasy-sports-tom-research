{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "George Pickens", "Hunter Henry"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "Team A is strong at RB but weak at WR. Trading Kamara (RB) and Pickens (WR) for St. Brown (WR) upgrades the WR position significantly. Achane (RB) replaces Kamara's production. Including Henry (TE) balances the trade value while Team A still has Kittle as a strong TE starter."}
