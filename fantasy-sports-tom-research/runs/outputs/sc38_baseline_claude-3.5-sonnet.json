{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Terry McLaurin", "Trevor Lawrence"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Upgrading RB position with Bijan Robinson, a top-tier RB. Slight downgrade at WR from McLaurin to Higgins, but still getting a strong WR. Trading Lawrence is manageable as we still have Daniels and Nix at QB. Overall, this trade improves our starting lineup."}
