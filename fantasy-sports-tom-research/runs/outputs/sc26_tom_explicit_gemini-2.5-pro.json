{"offer_from_A": ["David Njoku", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Jayden Reed", "J.K. Dobbins"], "rationale": "This trade balances both of our rosters. You get a reliable RB2 in Pollard and a top-10 TE in Njoku to solidify your depth, which is a significant upgrade. In return, you move a WR from your deep receiver corps and an RB with upside but a higher risk profile. It's a classic depth-for-a-starter swap that benefits us both."}
