{"offer_from_A": ["Bucky Irving", "George Pickens", "Dalton Kincaid"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Jalen McMillan"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB, WR, and TE for a star RB. Barkley significantly upgrades A's RB corps, while B gains three solid players to improve depth. Irving and Pickens have high potential, and Kincaid upgrades B's TE situation. B likely accepts due to receiving multiple starters for one, addressing depth issues across positions."}
