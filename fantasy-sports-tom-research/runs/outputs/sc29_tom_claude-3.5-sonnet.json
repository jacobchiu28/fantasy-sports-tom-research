{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Curtis Samuel", "Cade Otton"], "ask_from_B": ["Isiah Pacheco", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB and WR by acquiring Pacheco (11.5 proj) and Ridley (11.8 proj) for underperforming Chubb (4.7 proj) and Samuel (4.0 proj). Team B gains depth at TE with Otton (7.7 proj) and potential RB upside with Chubb. Fair value exchange addresses needs for both teams."}
