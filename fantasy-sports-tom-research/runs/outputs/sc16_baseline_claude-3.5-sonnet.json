{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Tyler Lockett", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "DeAndre Hopkins"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth for a star RB. Bijan Robinson is a significant upgrade over Mixon, while Hopkins replaces Lockett's production. Goedert is expendable with Kelce on the roster. This trade improves Team A's starting lineup without sacrificing too much depth."}
