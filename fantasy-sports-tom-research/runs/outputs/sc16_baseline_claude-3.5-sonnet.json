{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "George Pickens", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "We're offering a package of high-value players across different positions to acquire two elite performers. Taylor is an upgrade over Kamara at RB, while Lamb is a significant improvement to our WR corps. Hockenson's loss is mitigated by our TE depth."}
