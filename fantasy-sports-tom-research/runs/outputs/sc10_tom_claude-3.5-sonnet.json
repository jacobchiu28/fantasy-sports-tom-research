{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Terry McLaurin", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Cooper Kupp"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher projection than Jones, and gets a solid WR in Kupp to replace McLaurin. Team B gains depth with three quality players, addressing needs at WR and TE. Jones provides a good RB option, McLaurin upgrades their WR corps, and Goedert improves their TE situation. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
