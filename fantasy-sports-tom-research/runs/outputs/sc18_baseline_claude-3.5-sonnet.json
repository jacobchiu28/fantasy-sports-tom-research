{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Davante Adams", "Josh Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Chris Olave", "Bo Nix"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's RB situation by acquiring McCaffrey, a top-tier RB with higher projected points than Henry. Olave provides consistent WR production to replace Adams. Bo Nix offers similar QB production to Allen with potential upside. Team B gains a strong RB, elite WR, and top QB, addressing multiple positions."}
