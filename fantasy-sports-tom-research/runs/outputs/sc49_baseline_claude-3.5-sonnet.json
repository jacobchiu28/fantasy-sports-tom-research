{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Miles Sanders", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["D'Andre Swift", "Ashton Jeanty"], "reasoning": "Team A is deep at WR but needs RB improvement. Swift and Jeanty have higher projections than Chubb and Sanders. Godwin is expendable due to A's WR depth. This trade balances A's roster while upgrading RB production."}
