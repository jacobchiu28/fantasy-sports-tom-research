{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tyler Lockett", "Jonnu Smith"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade Josh Jacobs. Acquiring Jahmyr Gibbs provides a higher projected scorer. Upgrading at TE with Trey McBride significantly improves that position. Losing Tyler Lockett is manageable given Team A's WR depth. This trade balances positional needs and improves overall projected scoring for Team A."}
