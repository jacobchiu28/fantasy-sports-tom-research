{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "David Montgomery"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Dak Prescott"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to address its need for a true RB1, upgrading from Montgomery to Kamara. Team B has a surplus of startable RBs and a significant need for a top-tier QB. This trade provides Team B with a massive upgrade at QB with Lamar Jackson, while Team A still retains an elite starter in Jalen Hurts and gets a quality QB2 back. It's a mutually beneficial deal where both teams trade from a position of strength to fix a clear weakness."}
