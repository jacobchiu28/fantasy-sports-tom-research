{"offer_from_A": ["Tee Higgins", "Jake Ferguson"], "ask_from_B": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Dallas Goedert"], "rationale": "This trade addresses clear needs for both teams. Team B receives a legitimate WR1 in Tee Higgins to anchor its weakest position. It also resolves its TE logjam by trading Dallas Goedert for a very capable replacement in Jake Ferguson. Team A gives from its WR depth to acquire a much-needed, reliable RB2 in Aaron Jones Sr."}
