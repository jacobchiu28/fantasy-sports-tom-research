{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Drake London", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Allen", "Calvin Ridley", "J.K. Dobbins"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at QB with Josh Allen, while addressing WR depth with Ridley and maintaining RB strength with Dobbins. Team B gains a high-potential RB in Cook, a promising WR in London, and upgrades at TE with McBride. This trade balances both teams' needs, with Team B likely to accept due to improved depth and potential."}
