{"offer_from_A": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Chris Godwin", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Marquise Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A improves at RB with Josh Jacobs, who has a higher projection than Walker. Marquise Brown upgrades WR depth. Team B gains a solid RB in Walker, improves at TE with Pitts, and adds WR depth with Godwin. This trade addresses Team B's TE weakness and provides them with more balanced roster depth, making it appealing for both sides."}
