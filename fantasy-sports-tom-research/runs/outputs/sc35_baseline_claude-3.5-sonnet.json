{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Mike Evans", "Patrick Mahomes II"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner", "Brian Thomas Jr.", "Jalen Hurts"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by upgrading at QB with Hurts (22.0) over Mahomes (19.9), while also getting a high-scoring WR in Thomas Jr. (16.0). We give up Evans (14.6) but gain in overall WR points. Conner (14.1) is a slight upgrade over Etienne (10.0) at RB. Team B benefits from Mahomes' consistency and Evans' potential, while only slightly downgrading at RB."}
