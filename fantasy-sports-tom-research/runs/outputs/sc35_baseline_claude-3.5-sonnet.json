{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Josh Reynolds", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Sam LaPorta"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's WR and TE positions. Smith-Njigba (13.8 proj) is an upgrade over Reynolds (6.1 proj), while LaPorta (11.2 proj) offers higher upside than Schultz (7.0 proj). Montgomery is expendable due to Team A's RB depth. The trade balances value and addresses Team A's needs without significantly weakening other positions."}
