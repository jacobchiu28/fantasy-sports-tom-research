{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Davante Adams", "Baker Mayfield"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Mike Evans", "Jayden Daniels"], "reasoning": "This trade balances our RB depth, upgrades our QB, and maintains WR strength. We give up our top RB but get a solid RB2 in return. Daniels is a significant QB upgrade over Mayfield. Evans slightly offsets the loss of Adams while freeing up space for our promising young WRs."}
