{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "Jerry Jeudy", "Pat Freiermuth"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Puka Nacua"], "reasoning": "We're offering a package to upgrade at RB and WR. Barkley (19.3) is a significant upgrade over Kamara (14.7), while Nacua (16.9) offers higher upside than Jeudy (12.4). We're including Freiermuth to sweeten the deal, as Team B lacks TE depth. This trade improves our starting lineup while leveraging our depth at TE."}
