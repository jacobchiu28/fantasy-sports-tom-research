{"offer_from_A": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Jalen McMillan"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "DeAndre Hopkins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jahmyr Gibbs, a high-projection RB, and Jalen McMillan, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson, an elite RB, and DeAndre Hopkins, a WR with potential upside. Team A strengthens its RB position with a top-tier player and gains a WR with potential for improvement. Team B receives a promising RB in Gibbs, who can complement their existing RBs, and McMillan, who can bolster their WR depth, addressing their need for more consistent WR options. This trade is mutually beneficial as it balances both teams' rosters and addresses positional needs."}
