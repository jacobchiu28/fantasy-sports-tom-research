{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Keenan Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins"], "rationale": "Team B's roster is critically thin at RB behind Jonathan Taylor. This trade provides an immediate starting RB in Rhamondre Stevenson and a reliable WR2 in Keenan Allen to bolster their lineup. Team A leverages its superior RB and WR depth to consolidate two good players into one great one, acquiring an elite WR in Nico Collins to pair with Ja'Marr Chase without significantly hurting its overall roster strength."}
