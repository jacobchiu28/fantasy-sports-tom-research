{"offer_from_A": ["Trey McBride", "Alvin Kamara"], "ask_from_B": ["DK Metcalf", "James Cook"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial blockbuster addressing primary needs. Team A sends its elite TE and a top RB to acquire a true WR1 in Metcalf and a high-volume RB in Cook, significantly upgrading its starting WR corps. Team B receives a massive upgrade at its weakest position with McBride and a top-5 projected RB in Kamara by dealing from its deep pool of WR and RB talent."}
