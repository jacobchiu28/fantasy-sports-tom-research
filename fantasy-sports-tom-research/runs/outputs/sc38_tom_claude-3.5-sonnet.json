{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "Team A has surplus RBs but lacks WR depth. Trading Jacobs (RB15.5) and Pickens (WR12.1) for St. Brown (WR16.9) and Achane (RB17.1) improves A's WR corps significantly while maintaining RB strength. Team B gains a solid RB1 in Jacobs to address their RB weakness, and Pickens offers WR upside. This trade balances both teams' rosters, addressing their respective needs, making it mutually beneficial and likely to be accepted."}
