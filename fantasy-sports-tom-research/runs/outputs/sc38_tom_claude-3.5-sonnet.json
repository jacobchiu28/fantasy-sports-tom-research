{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane (RB, 17.1 proj) and Jerry Jeudy (WR, 12.4 proj) for Bijan Robinson (RB, 18.5 proj). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at RB with a top-tier talent in Robinson, while Team B gains depth with a solid RB and WR. Team B addresses their WR depth issue and gets a promising RB to offset losing Robinson. The combined projection of Achane and Jeudy (29.5) exceeds Robinson's (18.5), making it an attractive offer for Team B while still being fair."}
