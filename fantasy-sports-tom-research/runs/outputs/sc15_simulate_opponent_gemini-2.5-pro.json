{"offer_from_A": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Stefon Diggs"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams", "Tony Pollard"], "rationale": "Team A has a surplus of high-end RBs and can afford to move Kenneth Walker III to upgrade at WR from Stefon Diggs to the elite Davante Adams. Team B addresses its primary need for a true RB1, getting a significant upgrade in Walker over Tony Pollard, while only taking a minor step down at WR with Diggs, who remains a solid starter."}
