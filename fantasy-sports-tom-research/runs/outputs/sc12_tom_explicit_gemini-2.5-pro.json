{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["DeVonta Smith", "Austin Ekeler"], "rationale": "Your RB room is elite and deep; you can easily afford to move Austin Ekeler. This trade converts that RB depth and a good WR into a proven, top-tier TE in Mark Andrews, giving you an incredible positional advantage. You also receive a high-volume WR in Michael Pittman Jr. to replace Smith, strengthening your starting lineup across the board."}
