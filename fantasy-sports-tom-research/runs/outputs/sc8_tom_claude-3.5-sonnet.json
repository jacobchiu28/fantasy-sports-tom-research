{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Cooper Kupp", "Justin Herbert"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Jerry Jeudy"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and WR plus a top QB for a star RB and solid WR. Team B gains a high-end QB (Herbert) to upgrade from Stafford, a WR1 in Kupp, and a solid RB2 in Stevenson. Team A receives an elite RB1 in Taylor to pair with Harris, and Jeudy as a WR2/3. This trade balances both teams' needs, with Team B improving at QB and WR while maintaining RB strength, and Team A upgrading significantly at RB without sacrificing too much WR depth."}
