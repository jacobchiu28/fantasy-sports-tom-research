{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Zay Flowers", "Pat Freiermuth"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and a solid WR/TE combo for Team B's star WR and a good RB. This trade benefits Team A by acquiring a top WR talent in Jefferson to boost their receiving corps, while maintaining RB strength with Jones. Team B gains a high-scoring RB in Henry, a promising young WR in Flowers, and upgrades at TE with Freiermuth. This addresses Team B's need for RB depth and TE improvement, while leveraging their WR strength. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both teams."}
