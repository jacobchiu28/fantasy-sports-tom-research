{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Baker Mayfield"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Chuba Hubbard"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its QB surplus to acquire a significant upgrade at TE and bolster its RB depth. Team B shores up its biggest weakness (QB2) by trading from its positions of strength (RB depth and an elite TE), acquiring a top-tier backup for Josh Allen and still retaining an elite TE in Mark Andrews."}
