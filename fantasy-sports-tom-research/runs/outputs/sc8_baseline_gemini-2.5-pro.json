{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Derrick Henry"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers", "Josh Jacobs"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for an elite WR by acquiring Malik Nabers, leveraging its significant QB depth with Trevor Lawrence. The swap of Derrick Henry for Josh Jacobs maintains a strong RB1 for Team A. For Team B, this trade provides a substantial upgrade at their weakest position, QB, and lands them a premier workhorse running back in Henry, solidifying two key starting spots."}
