{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Calvin Ridley"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering David Montgomery and Calvin Ridley to acquire Bijan Robinson from Team B. Montgomery and Ridley have solid projections, but Robinson has a higher ceiling and can significantly boost Team A's RB lineup alongside Saquon Barkley. This trade balances Team B's roster by adding a strong WR and a reliable RB, while Team A consolidates its RB strength with a top-tier player."}
