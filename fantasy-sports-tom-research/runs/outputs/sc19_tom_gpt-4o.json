{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Diontae Johnson"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Travis Etienne Jr. and Diontae Johnson to Team B in exchange for De'Von Achane. Team A strengthens its RB position with Achane, who has a higher projection than Etienne. Team B receives Etienne, who can bolster their RB depth, and Johnson, who adds depth to their WRs, addressing their need for more reliable WR options. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B gains depth and potential starters in both RB and WR positions, while Team A upgrades their RB position with a higher projected player."}
