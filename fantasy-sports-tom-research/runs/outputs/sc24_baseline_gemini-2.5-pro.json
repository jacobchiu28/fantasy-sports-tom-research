{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield"], "ask_from_B": ["David Njoku", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "reasoning": "This trade addresses Team A's biggest needs by acquiring a top-tier TE in Njoku and a reliable WR2 in Pittman Jr. We are dealing from our deepest position, QB, offering our highest-projected player. For Team B, this provides a significant QB upgrade over their current backups and solidifies the most important position on their roster by trading away players from their positions of depth."}
