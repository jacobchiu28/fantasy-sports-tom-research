{"offer_from_A": ["David Njoku", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Chris Olave"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' needs by leveraging positional strengths. Team A is weak at RB and can afford to trade from its WR/TE depth. We offer a top-10 TE in Njoku and a high-upside young WR in Jaxon Smith-Njigba to acquire a true RB1 in Kenneth Walker III and a proven WR in Chris Olave. For Team B, this is a consolidation move. You have incredible RB depth and two elite TEs, making Walker expendable and Njoku a valuable asset. You swap Olave for a younger receiver with a high ceiling in JSN, strengthening your future while maintaining an elite WR corps."}
