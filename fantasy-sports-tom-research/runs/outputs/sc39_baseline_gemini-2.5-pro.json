{"offer_from_A": ["DJ Moore", "D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win targeting each team's primary needs. Team A has exceptional depth at WR but lacks a true top-tier RB. Team B is stacked at RB with both Gibbs and Bijan Robinson but is very thin at WR after Drake London. By trading DJ Moore and D'Andre Swift, Team A consolidates two strong starters to acquire an elite, high-upside RB in Jahmyr Gibbs, instantly fixing its biggest roster weakness. Team B receives a legitimate WR1 in DJ Moore to create a formidable receiving duo with London, and also acquires a solid starting RB in D'Andre Swift to plug into their lineup, ensuring they don't lose significant RB production. This move allows both teams to balance their rosters by trading from a position of strength."}
