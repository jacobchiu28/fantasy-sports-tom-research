{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "Jake Ferguson"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade where Team A consolidates assets to acquire a top-tier WR1, its biggest need. Team B trades from a position of strength (Ja'Marr Chase) to address its lack of depth and upgrade its TE position significantly. Team A gets an elite WR to lead its young corps, while only taking a manageable downgrade at TE by receiving Ferguson and still rostering Dalton Kincaid. Team B diversifies its assets, creating a more balanced and less top-heavy roster by adding an elite TE in Kittle and a strong WR2 in Higgins, raising their weekly floor and making them less vulnerable to injury."}
