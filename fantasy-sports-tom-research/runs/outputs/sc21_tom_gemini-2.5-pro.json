{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Jordan Love"], "ask_from_B": ["Garrett Wilson", "Jalen Hurts"], "reasoning": "This is a blockbuster QB and TE swap that benefits both teams. Team A has elite QB depth with Josh Allen, Dak Prescott, and Jordan Love. Team B has a similar situation with Jalen Hurts, Baker Mayfield, and Brock Purdy. This trade proposes a swap of high-end QBs (Love for Hurts), which is a slight upgrade for Team A based on projections and gives Team B a top young QB to build around or use as a premier asset. The key for Team B is acquiring Mark Andrews. Team B's biggest roster weakness is TE, where they are starting players with ~7 point projections. Mark Andrews is a top-3 TE who immediately solves this massive need. In return, Team A gets Garrett Wilson, an elite young WR to pair with Tyreek Hill, addressing their need for a dominant WR2. Team A can afford to move Andrews because they also have rookie standout Brock Bowers. Essentially, Team A consolidates its QB and TE depth into an elite WR, while Team B uses its QB depth and a strong WR to fix its most significant positional hole with an elite TE."}
