{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Marvin Harrison Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Jameson Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry (RB) and Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR) for Bijan Robinson (RB) and Jameson Williams (WR). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with the younger, higher-projected Robinson while maintaining WR depth. Team B gains an elite veteran RB in Henry and a potential WR1 in Harrison Jr., addressing their need for a top WR. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both sides."}
