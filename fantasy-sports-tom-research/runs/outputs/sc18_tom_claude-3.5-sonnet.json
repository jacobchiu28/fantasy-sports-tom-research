{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Trevor Lawrence"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "DJ Moore", "Justin Fields"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Gibbs (17.9 proj) over Etienne (10.0 proj), while Team B gets a solid RB2 in Etienne. Team A also improves at WR with DJ Moore (13.1 proj) over Smith-Njigba (13.8 proj), but the difference is minimal. The QB swap is relatively even, with Fields (15.8 proj) having slightly less projection than Lawrence (17.9 proj), but higher upside. Team B might accept this trade to improve depth at RB and WR, while only slightly downgrading at QB. The trade is balanced and addresses positional needs for both teams."}
