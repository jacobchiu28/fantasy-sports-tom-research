{"offer_from_A": ["Kyren Williams", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Jaylen Warren"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth at RB for a WR upgrade, while Team B gains a high-scoring RB and solid WR. This addresses Team A's need for a consistent WR2 and Team B's RB depth issue. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both sides."}
