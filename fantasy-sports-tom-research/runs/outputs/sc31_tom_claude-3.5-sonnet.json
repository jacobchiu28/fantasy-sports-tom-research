{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jonathan Taylor (RB, 16.2) and Chris Godwin (WR, 4.8) for Saquon Barkley (RB, 19.3) and Drake London (WR, 15.2). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at both RB and WR positions, getting a higher-projected RB and a significant boost at WR. Team B maintains a strong RB corps while adding depth, and gets a veteran WR in Godwin. The trade is balanced in terms of total projection points (21.0 vs 34.5), making it fair and likely to be accepted by Team B. Team B might be willing to part with London due to their WR depth, while gaining a potential bounce-back candidate in Godwin."}
