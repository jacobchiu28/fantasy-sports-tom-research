{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "Matthew Golden"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaylen Warren, a solid RB with 11.0 projection, and Matthew Golden, a promising WR with 11.6 projection, to Team B in exchange for Kyren Williams, a high-performing RB with a 15.2 projection. Team A strengthens its RB position with a higher projected player, while Team B gains depth with a strong RB and a WR, addressing their need for a more balanced roster. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B receives two players with good projections, enhancing their overall lineup."}
