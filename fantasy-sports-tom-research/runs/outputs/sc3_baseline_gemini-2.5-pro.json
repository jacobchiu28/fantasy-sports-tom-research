{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jayden Reed"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of high-end RBs and a significant need for an elite WR1. This trade consolidates two strong starters (Henry, Reed) to acquire a top-tier WR in Ja'Marr Chase, creating a formidable WR duo with Nico Collins. For Team B, this is a chance to cash in on their incredible WR depth (they still have Lamb and Nacua) to acquire a proven RB1 workhorse in Henry and a quality young WR in Reed, strengthening their overall roster depth."}
