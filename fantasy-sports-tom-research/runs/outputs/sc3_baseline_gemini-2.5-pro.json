{"offer_from_A": ["Kyler Murray", "Isiah Pacheco"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Cooper Kupp"], "reasoning": "Team A is leveraging its significant depth at QB, where Kyler Murray, Brock Purdy, and Justin Herbert are all strong starters, to address its biggest need: elite talent at the skill positions. Team B's roster is stacked at RB with Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs, but lacks a top-tier QB. This trade sends Kyler Murray to Team B to be their definitive QB1. In return, Team A acquires Bijan Robinson, creating a dominant RB duo with Christian McCaffrey. The inclusion of Isiah Pacheco from A and Cooper Kupp from B balances the deal from a value and positional need perspective; Team A gets a much-needed reliable WR2, and Team B receives a solid starting RB to maintain its depth after parting with Bijan."}
