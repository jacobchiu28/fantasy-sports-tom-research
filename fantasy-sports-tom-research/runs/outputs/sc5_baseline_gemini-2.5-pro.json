{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams", "James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "DJ Moore"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses the biggest needs for both teams. Team A has incredible depth at WR but is weak at RB, needing a true workhorse back. Team B has solid RB depth with Jonathan Taylor but lacks a top-tier, proven WR1. This deal sends Team A's WR depth (Davante Adams) and a solid RB (James Cook) to Team B in exchange for an elite RB1 (Jonathan Taylor) and a reliable WR2 (DJ Moore). Team A significantly upgrades its starting RB position, creating a more balanced and powerful starting lineup, while still maintaining an elite WR corps. Team B acquires the high-volume WR1 it needs in Adams and a very capable replacement for Taylor in Cook, balancing out its own roster."}
