{"offer_from_A": ["DK Metcalf", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A consolidates its strong WR depth and a solid RB to acquire an elite, high-projection RB, which is its biggest need. Team B has incredible RB depth and can afford to move a top asset to acquire a much-needed proven WR2 in DK Metcalf and a reliable RB2/Flex in Rhamondre Stevenson, significantly bolstering their shallow WR corps."}
