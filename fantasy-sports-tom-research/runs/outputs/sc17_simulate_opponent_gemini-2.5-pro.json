{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "DeMario Douglas"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Tetairoa McMillan"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial trade. Team A addresses its critical need for a top WR by acquiring McMillan, while also getting a high-end RB in Hall. Team B upgrades its RB room with an elite talent in Taylor to pair with Bijan and adds a solid starting WR in Douglas to bolster its receiver corps. Both teams improve their starting lineups by trading from positions of depth."}
