{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Drake London"], "ask_from_B": ["Chase Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Joe Mixon and Drake London to Team B in exchange for Chase Brown. Team A has a surplus of RBs and WRs, and acquiring Chase Brown, who has a high projection, strengthens their RB position. Team B receives Joe Mixon, who can provide depth at RB, and Drake London, who bolsters their WR lineup, addressing their need for a stronger WR core. This trade is mutually beneficial as it balances both teams' rosters and addresses Team B's need for a reliable WR."}
