{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Rome Odunze"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "George Pickens"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a high-value RB, and Rome Odunze, a promising WR, to Team B. In return, Team A asks for Jahmyr Gibbs, a top-performing RB, and George Pickens, a solid WR. This trade benefits Team A by acquiring a younger RB with a higher projection and a reliable WR, addressing their need for a stronger WR lineup. Team B receives a proven RB in Henry to bolster their RB depth and a WR with potential, which complements their existing WR strength. Team B is likely to accept as they gain a veteran RB and maintain WR depth."}
