{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Marvin Harrison Jr."], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing key needs. You receive a top-3 proven TE in Kittle, a significant upgrade for your roster, by trading from your WR depth. We receive a high-upside WR in Marvin Harrison Jr. to bolster our receiving corps, and can make this move due to our TE depth with Evan Engram."}
