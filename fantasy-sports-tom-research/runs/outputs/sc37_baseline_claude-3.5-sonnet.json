{"offer_from_A": ["Kyren Williams", "Puka Nacua", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Kenneth Walker III", "C.J. Stroud"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We're offering Kyren Williams (15.2) and Puka Nacua (16.9), who have high projections but may regress, for CeeDee Lamb (17.4) and Kenneth Walker III (13.7), who are more consistent performers. Swapping Joe Burrow (20.0) for C.J. Stroud (16.2) allows us to maintain QB strength while acquiring valuable assets at RB and WR positions."}
