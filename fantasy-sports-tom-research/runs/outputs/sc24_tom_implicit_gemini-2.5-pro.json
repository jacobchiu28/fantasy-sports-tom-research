{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Brock Purdy"], "ask_from_B": ["Joe Burrow", "Alvin Kamara"], "rationale": "We are strong at RB but need a top-tier QB; you are overloaded with elite QBs but could use a true RB1. This swap addresses both teams' primary needs. You upgrade from Kamara to Barkley, solidifying your RB corps, and get a reliable starter in Purdy while still having Lamar, Stroud, and Murray. We get the elite QB we're looking for."}
