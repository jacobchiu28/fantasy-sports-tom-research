{"offer_from_A": ["Tyler Allgeier", "Curtis Samuel", "Tyler Higbee"], "ask_from_B": ["Chase Brown", "Josh Downs"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth for a potential RB2 in Chase Brown (15.4 proj) and a promising WR in Josh Downs (9.9 proj). This improves A's RB corps and adds WR depth. Team B gains roster flexibility with three players at different positions."}
