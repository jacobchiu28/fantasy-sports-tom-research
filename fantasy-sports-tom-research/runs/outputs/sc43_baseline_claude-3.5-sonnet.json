{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Chris Olave"], "ask_from_B": ["Drake London", "Alvin Kamara"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster balance. We're trading Henry (16.2) for Kamara (14.7), a slight downgrade at RB, but gaining Drake London (15.2) for Chris Olave (10.9), a significant upgrade at WR. This trade addresses Team A's strength at RB while bolstering the WR corps, resulting in a more balanced and potentially higher-scoring lineup."}
