{"offer_from_A": ["DK Metcalf"], "ask_from_B": ["T.J. Hockenson"], "reasoning": "This trade directly addresses both teams' primary roster imbalances. Team A desperately needs an elite TE and can afford to move a top WR to get one. Team B has a surplus of elite TEs with both Sam LaPorta and T.J. Hockenson, making one of them a high-value bench player. This deal allows Team B to convert that bench asset into a locked-in weekly starting WR in DK Metcalf, significantly improving their starting lineup's firepower. Team A solves its biggest positional weakness, creating a much more balanced and competitive roster."}
