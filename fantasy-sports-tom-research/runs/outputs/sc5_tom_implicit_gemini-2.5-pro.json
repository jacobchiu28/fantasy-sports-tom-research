{"offer_from_A": ["Sam LaPorta"], "ask_from_B": ["DeVonta Smith"], "rationale": "This trade addresses the most significant needs for both rosters. Team A receives a proven, high-end WR in DeVonta Smith to lead its receiving corps by leveraging its extraordinary depth at tight end. Team B acquires an elite, top-3 TE in Sam LaPorta, instantly fixing its biggest positional weakness while trading from its strong group of wide receivers."}
