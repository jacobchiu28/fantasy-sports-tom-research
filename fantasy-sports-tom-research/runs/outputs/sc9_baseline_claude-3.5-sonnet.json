{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Marvin Harrison Jr.", "Jordan Love"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Travis Etienne Jr.", "Lamar Jackson"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We're giving up a top RB (Robinson) but getting a solid replacement (Etienne) plus upgrading at WR with Lamb. The QB swap from Love to Jackson is a significant upgrade, giving us a dual-threat QB with higher projected points. This trade balances our roster while acquiring high-ceiling players."}
