{"offer_from_A": ["Tony Pollard", "Xavier Worthy", "Sam LaPorta"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Jaylen Waddle"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and WR, allowing us to package Pollard (solid RB2) with Worthy (high-potential WR) and LaPorta (emerging TE) to acquire Achane (high-scoring RB) and Waddle (consistent WR1). This trade improves our starting lineup while leveraging our depth."}
