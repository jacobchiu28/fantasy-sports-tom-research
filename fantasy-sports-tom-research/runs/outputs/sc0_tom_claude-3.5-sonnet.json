{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Zay Flowers"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jonathan Taylor (RB) and Michael Pittman Jr. (WR) for De'Von Achane (RB) and Zay Flowers (WR). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Achane's higher projection (17.1 vs 16.2) and gets a slight upgrade at WR with Flowers (13.1 vs 10.3). Team B receives a solid RB in Taylor and gets Pittman, who has good chemistry with Richardson. This trade addresses Team B's need for RB depth behind Jacobs and gives them a reliable WR. Team B likely accepts as they get two starters for two less established players, balancing risk and upside."}
