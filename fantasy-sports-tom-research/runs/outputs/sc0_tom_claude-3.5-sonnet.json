{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "A.J. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Justin Jefferson"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Barkley and maintains elite WR production with Jefferson. Team B gets an elite QB in Hurts and a top WR in Brown, improving their passing game. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both sides. Team B likely accepts due to the significant QB upgrade and the potential for a high-scoring QB-WR stack."}
