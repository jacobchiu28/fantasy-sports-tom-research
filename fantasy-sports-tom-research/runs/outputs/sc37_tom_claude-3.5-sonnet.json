{"offer_from_A": ["Kyren Williams", "Cooper Kupp", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Kenneth Walker III", "C.J. Stroud"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with CeeDee Lamb, who has a higher projection than Cooper Kupp. They also get a solid RB in Kenneth Walker III to replace Kyren Williams. C.J. Stroud is a slight downgrade from Joe Burrow, but still a capable QB. Team B receives a high-scoring RB in Kyren Williams, addressing their RB depth. They also get a star WR in Cooper Kupp and upgrade at QB with Joe Burrow. This trade balances both teams' needs and provides fair value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
