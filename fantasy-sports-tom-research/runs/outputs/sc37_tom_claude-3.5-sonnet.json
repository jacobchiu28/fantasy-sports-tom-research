{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Davante Adams"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth at RB for an upgrade at WR, while Team B gains a top RB and a solid WR2. Walker III's projection is slightly lower than Jacobs', but Adams is a significant upgrade over Kupp. This trade balances both teams' rosters and addresses their needs."}
