{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Rachaad White"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Geno Smith"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win targeting each team's biggest need. Team A has elite QB depth with Jalen Hurts and Brock Purdy, allowing them to trade Baker Mayfield to acquire a true RB1 in De'Von Achane, massively upgrading their weakest starting position. Team B's QB situation is dire, and Mayfield (19.2 proj) immediately becomes their undisputed starter and a significant upgrade over Geno Smith (14.4 proj). Team B can easily afford to trade Achane due to their incredible RB depth (Saquon Barkley, James Conner, Chuba Hubbard), making this a logical move to solve their most glaring roster weakness."}
