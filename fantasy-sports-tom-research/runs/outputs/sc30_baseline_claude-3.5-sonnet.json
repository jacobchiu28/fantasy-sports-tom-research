{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Tony Pollard", "Chris Olave", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and WR, allowing us to trade Barkley and Pickens. We acquire Pollard to maintain RB strength, upgrade at TE with Kittle, and add Olave for WR depth. This trade improves our overall roster balance and potential scoring."}
