{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Baker Mayfield"], "reasoning": "Team A trades away Derrick Henry (16.2) and Joe Burrow (20.0) for Jahmyr Gibbs (17.9) and Baker Mayfield (19.2). This trade improves Team A's RB depth with a younger, high-upside player in Gibbs, while maintaining strong QB production with Mayfield. Team B gets an elite QB upgrade and a solid veteran RB."}
