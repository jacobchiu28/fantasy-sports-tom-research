{"offer_from_A": ["Deebo Samuel Sr.", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Tank Bigsby"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its biggest need by acquiring an elite TE in Trey McBride, leveraging its significant WR and RB depth by trading Deebo Samuel Sr. and Rhamondre Stevenson. Team B significantly improves its weak WR corps with Deebo and adds a solid starting RB, and can afford to move McBride as they have a capable backup in Kyle Pitts Sr."}
