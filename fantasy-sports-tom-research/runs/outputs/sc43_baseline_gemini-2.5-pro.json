{"offer_from_A": ["Brian Robinson Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "reasoning": "Team A has elite RB depth with Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs, making Brian Robinson Jr. a valuable, expendable asset to address a clear need for a high-upside WR. Acquiring Jaxon Smith-Njigba strengthens the starting WR corps alongside Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chris Olave. For Team B, their RB room is a major weakness, and Brian Robinson Jr. would be an immediate, significant upgrade and likely their RB1. Team B can make this move due to their existing WR depth in Marquise Brown and Josh Downs, making it a mutually beneficial trade that addresses each team's primary need."}
