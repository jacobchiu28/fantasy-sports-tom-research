{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Malik Nabers"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB and WR positions with higher projected players. Offering Jaylen Warren and Terry McLaurin, who have solid projections, in exchange for Derrick Henry and Malik Nabers, who have slightly higher projections, provides an upgrade. This trade balances Team B's roster by adding depth to their RB and WR positions while giving Team A a boost in projected points."}
