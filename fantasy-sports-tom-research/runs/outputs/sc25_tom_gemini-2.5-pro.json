{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's primary need by swapping players at positions of strength. Team A has elite RBs (McCaffrey, Bijan) and TEs (Kelce, Njoku) but desperately needs a WR1. Team B is loaded at WR (Lamb, London, Flowers) but lacks a true top-tier RB1. By trading Bijan Robinson, Team A acquires the elite WR1 it needs in CeeDee Lamb while still rostering Christian McCaffrey. The TE swap is a near-even exchange (Njoku for Andrews) that balances the value, giving Team B a massive upgrade at their weakest starting position (RB) in exchange for a player from their deepest position (WR)."}
