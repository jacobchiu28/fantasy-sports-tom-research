{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "Cooper Kupp", "Jake Ferguson"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall projected points. We're giving up Kamara (14.7) and Kupp (11.1) for higher-scoring Barkley (19.3) and Lamb (17.4). Ferguson (8.5) is included to balance, as we have depth at TE. This trade significantly upgrades our RB1 and WR1 positions."}
