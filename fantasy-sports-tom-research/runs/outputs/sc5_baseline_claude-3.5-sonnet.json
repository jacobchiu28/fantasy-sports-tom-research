{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "George Pickens", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and WR for an elite RB1 in Taylor and a high-upside WR in London. Cook and Pickens are solid but expendable for A, while Pitts has potential but is underperforming. This trade upgrades A's starting lineup significantly while B gains depth and potential breakout players."}
