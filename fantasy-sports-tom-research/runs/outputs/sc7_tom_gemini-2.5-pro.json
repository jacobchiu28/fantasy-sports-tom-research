{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "Wan'Dale Robinson"], "ask_from_B": ["George Kittle", "Terry McLaurin"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win, addressing each team's primary need by trading from a position of surplus. Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a top-tier TE in George Kittle, filling its biggest roster hole, and a solid WR2 in Terry McLaurin. Team B consolidates its TE and WR depth to acquire a premier QB in Jalen Hurts, a significant upgrade that raises their weekly ceiling. With Mark Andrews still on the roster, Team B can afford to move Kittle, and their deep WR corps easily absorbs the departure of McLaurin, making this a highly logical and beneficial move for them."}
