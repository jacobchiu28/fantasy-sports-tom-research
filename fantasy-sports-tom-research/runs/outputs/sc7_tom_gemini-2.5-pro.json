{"offer_from_A": ["DJ Moore", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "This trade is a mutually beneficial deal addressing each team's key needs. Team A has significant WR depth and can offer a proven talent like DJ Moore to acquire an elite RB with massive upside in De'Von Achane, creating a dominant backfield with Christian McCaffrey. Team B's most pressing need is a true #1 wide receiver, a role DJ Moore immediately fills. In exchange for Achane, a player from their deepest position group, they also receive a capable starting RB in Javonte Williams, ensuring their RB room remains stacked while drastically improving their starting WRs. This move strengthens both rosters in critical areas."}
