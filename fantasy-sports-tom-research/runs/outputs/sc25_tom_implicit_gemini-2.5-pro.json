{"offer_from_A": ["DJ Moore", "Alvin Kamara"], "ask_from_B": ["Ashton Jeanty", "Jerry Jeudy"], "rationale": "Team B addresses its biggest need by acquiring a proven WR1 in DJ Moore and gets a reliable veteran RB in Alvin Kamara. This provides two immediate, high-floor starters to fill roster holes. In return, Team A consolidates its running back room with the high-upside rookie Ashton Jeanty and acquires a solid WR2 in Jerry Jeudy to maintain depth."}
