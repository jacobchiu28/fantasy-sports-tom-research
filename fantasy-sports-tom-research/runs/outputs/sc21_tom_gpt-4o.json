{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Joe Mixon and Tee Higgins to Team B in exchange for De'Von Achane. Team A aims to strengthen their RB position with Achane's high projection of 17.1, which is higher than Mixon's 8.9. Team B, with a strong RB lineup, can afford to lose Achane and gain a solid WR in Higgins, who has a 14.4 projection, and Mixon to maintain RB depth. This trade balances Team B's WR needs while enhancing Team A's RB strength."}
