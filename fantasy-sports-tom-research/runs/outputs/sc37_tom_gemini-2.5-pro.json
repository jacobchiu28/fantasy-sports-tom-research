{"offer_from_A": ["Cooper Kupp", "Jared Goff"], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial, addressing key weaknesses by trading from positions of strength. Team A upgrades significantly at RB with James Cook and at TE with Mark Andrews, strengthening two of its weaker starting spots. Team B, who has immense depth at RB and TE, shores up its weak WR corps by adding a reliable target in Cooper Kupp and gets a high-end QB2 in Jared Goff to back up Joe Burrow."}
