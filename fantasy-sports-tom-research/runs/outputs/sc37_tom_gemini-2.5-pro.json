{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Mike Evans"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses clear needs for both teams. Team A has elite QB depth with Joe Burrow as the starter, making Trevor Lawrence a valuable trade asset. In return, they acquire a top-tier RB in Kenneth Walker III to strengthen their running back corps and receive a significant upgrade at WR with Mike Evans. Team B has a surplus of strong RBs and a cluster of good, but not great, QBs. They receive a major QB upgrade in Trevor Lawrence, giving them a higher ceiling at the position, and add a reliable WR2 in Cooper Kupp to provide depth behind CeeDee Lamb. This is a classic strength-for-strength trade that makes both rosters more balanced and potent."}
