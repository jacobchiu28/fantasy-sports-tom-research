{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson"], "ask_from_B": ["Dallas Goedert", "Jerry Jeudy"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A leverages its elite QB depth to solve its biggest need at TE, upgrading significantly from Cade Otton to Dallas Goedert while retaining Kyler Murray as a strong starter. Team B acquires a league-winning talent in Lamar Jackson, a massive upgrade over their current QBs, by trading from their positions of strength at TE (they still have Kyle Pitts) and WR depth."}
