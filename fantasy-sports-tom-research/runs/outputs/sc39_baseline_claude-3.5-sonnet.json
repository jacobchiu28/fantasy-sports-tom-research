{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "DeVonta Smith", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and WR for Team B's top RB. Bijan Robinson is a significant upgrade over Aaron Jones Sr., while Drake London provides a high-ceiling WR to replace DeVonta Smith. George Kittle is included to balance the trade, as he's a top TE. This trade improves Team A's RB situation substantially while maintaining strong WR and TE depth."}
