{"offer_from_A": ["Bucky Irving", "Malik Nabers", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall talent and projected points. We're offering Irving (16.3), Nabers (16.7), and Hockenson (10.7) for a total of 43.7 projected points. In return, we're getting Chase (19.5) and Cook (14.2) for 33.7 projected points. While we're giving up more total points, we're acquiring the highest-projected player in the trade (Chase) and a solid RB in Cook. This consolidates value into fewer roster spots, allowing for potential waiver wire pickups. The trade addresses Team A's need for a top-tier WR and additional RB depth."}
