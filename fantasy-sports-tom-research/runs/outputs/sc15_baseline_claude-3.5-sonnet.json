{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Jerry Jeudy", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's RB and WR positions. We're giving up Montgomery (11.5 proj) for Hall (12.7 proj), a slight upgrade at RB. We're also upgrading at WR by acquiring London (15.2 proj) for Jeudy (12.4 proj). We're including Goedert (9.2 proj) to sweeten the deal, as Team B's TE options are weaker. This trade balances improving our roster while offering fair value to Team B."}
