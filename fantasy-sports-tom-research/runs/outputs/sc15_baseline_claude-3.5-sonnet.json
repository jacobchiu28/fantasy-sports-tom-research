{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Malik Nabers", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tee Higgins", "Lamar Jackson"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We upgrade at RB with Ekeler, get a top WR in Higgins, and swap Burrow for the higher-scoring Jackson at QB. We're giving up potential in Achane and Nabers, but getting proven performers in return."}
