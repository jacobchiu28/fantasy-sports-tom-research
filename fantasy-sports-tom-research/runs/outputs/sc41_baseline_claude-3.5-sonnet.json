{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and WR, allowing us to package Josh Jacobs (15.5 proj) and Jaylen Waddle (11.7 proj) for Christian McCaffrey (18.6 proj). McCaffrey is a significant upgrade at RB, offering the highest projected points among all players. This trade improves our starting lineup while leveraging our depth."}
