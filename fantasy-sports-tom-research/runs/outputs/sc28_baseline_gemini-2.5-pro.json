{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels", "Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Team A is leveraging its greatest strength, QB depth, to acquire the consensus #1 overall player in fantasy football. Jayden Daniels is a massive upgrade for Team B's QB room. While losing Davante Adams hurts, Team A has strong WR depth with Chase, Nabers, and Hunter, and acquiring Christian McCaffrey creates an elite RB duo with Derrick Henry, fundamentally transforming the team's championship upside by addressing its biggest positional need."}
