{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Breece Hall"], "ask_from_B": ["C.J. Stroud", "Brian Thomas Jr."], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its primary need for a high-end WR2 in Brian Thomas Jr. by trading from its deep QB and RB rooms. While downgrading slightly from Lawrence to Stroud, Team A still maintains an elite QB in Joe Burrow. Team B receives a significant upgrade at RB with Breece Hall, addressing their biggest roster weakness, and gets a projected QB upgrade in Trevor Lawrence while trading from their own QB and WR depth."}
