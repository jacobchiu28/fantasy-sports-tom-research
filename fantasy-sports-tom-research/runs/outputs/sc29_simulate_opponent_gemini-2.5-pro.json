{"offer_from_A": ["Tee Higgins", "Dak Prescott"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Trey McBride"], "rationale": "This trade addresses major needs for both teams by leveraging positional surpluses. Team A acquires a legitimate RB1 and an elite TE to fix its biggest weaknesses, dealing from its incredible QB and WR depth. Team B consolidates its RB/TE depth, which includes McCaffrey, Kittle, and Kelce, into a much-needed high-end WR in Higgins and a quality QB asset in Prescott, creating a more balanced starting lineup."}
