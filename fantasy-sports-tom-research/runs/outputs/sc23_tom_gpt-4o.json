{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Rashee Rice"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of RBs and needs a more reliable RB option. Joe Mixon is underperforming, and Rashee Rice is a low-tier WR. Team B has depth at RB but lacks WR depth. James Conner is a solid RB option for Team A, while Rashee Rice provides potential WR depth for Team B. This trade balances both teams' needs, with Team B gaining a WR and a backup RB, and Team A getting a more consistent RB."}
