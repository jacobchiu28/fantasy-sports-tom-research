{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Brock Bowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Puka Nacua", "Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "This trade is a win-win, addressing each team's primary need by swapping players of similar value at one position to facilitate an upgrade at another. Team A has incredible depth at TE (Bowers, Andrews, Hockenson) but needs a true WR1; Puka Nacua (16.9 proj) fills this role perfectly. Team B is weak at TE behind George Kittle and would receive the highly-touted rookie Brock Bowers (14.4 proj), a massive upgrade. The RB swap is a nearly lateral move in value (Bijan Robinson 18.5 proj for Jahmyr Gibbs 17.9 proj), allowing both teams to exchange elite assets without creating a new roster hole. Team B solidifies its TE position for years to come, while Team A acquires the top-tier WR it needs to become a true contender."}
