{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["David Njoku", "Isiah Pacheco"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses key needs for both teams. Team A has significant QB depth and a glaring weakness at TE; this deal offloads a surplus QB for a top-10 TE in David Njoku and swaps a mid-tier RB for a comparable one in Isiah Pacheco. Team B has an abundance of quality RBs and can easily afford to part with Pacheco; in return, they acquire the highest-projected QB on either roster in Baker Mayfield, providing a high-floor veteran starter to complement their rookie QBs, and can comfortably start Dalton Schultz at TE."}
