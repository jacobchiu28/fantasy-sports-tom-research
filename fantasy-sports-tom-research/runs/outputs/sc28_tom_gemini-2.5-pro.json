{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "J.K. Dobbins"], "ask_from_B": ["Brian Thomas Jr.", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A addresses its need for a high-upside WR by acquiring Brian Thomas Jr., while trading from its TE strength. Team B rectifies its most significant weakness by acquiring elite TE George Kittle, a massive upgrade over their current options. The RB swap is a secondary component that balances team construction; Team A gets a slightly more reliable option in Aaron Jones Sr., and Team B gets a younger RB with potential in J.K. Dobbins. Team B is highly likely to accept as the value of securing a top-tier player at the scarce TE position outweighs parting with a rookie WR."}
