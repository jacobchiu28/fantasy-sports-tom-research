{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Trey McBride"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes weekly projected points for Team A's starting lineup by upgrading at two key positions. We acquire an elite TE in Trey McBride (14.6 proj vs. Andrews' 10.8) and a high-end WR2 in Nico Collins (15.9 proj) by capitalizing on our QB depth (trading backup Baker Mayfield) and packaging our current tight end."}
