{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Nico Collins"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses Team A's critical need for an elite WR by acquiring Ja'Marr Chase, consolidating two strong starters into a true superstar. For Team B, it resolves their WR logjam by converting a surplus elite asset into a workhorse RB in Derrick Henry and a high-end WR1 replacement in Nico Collins. Team B strengthens its RB corps significantly while maintaining an elite WR duo (Lamb/Nacua), making the trade mutually beneficial and addressing each team's primary roster imbalance."}
