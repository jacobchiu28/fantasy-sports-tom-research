{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Jaylen Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Trey McBride"], "rationale": "This trade significantly boosts Team A's projected weekly score by acquiring elite players at two key positions. Jahmyr Gibbs (17.9 proj) is a substantial upgrade at RB over Jaylen Warren (11.0 proj). More importantly, Trey McBride (14.6 proj) shores up Team A's biggest weakness at tight end, providing a massive point increase over current options. The trade leverages Team A's exceptional QB depth by dealing Justin Herbert while retaining three other high-quality starting options."}
