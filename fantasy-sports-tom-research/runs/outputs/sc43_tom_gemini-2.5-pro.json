{"offer_from_A": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "DeVonta Smith"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial. Team A addresses its biggest need by acquiring an elite TE in Trey McBride, a significant upgrade over Goedert. In return, Team B gets the true WR1 they lack in Amon-Ra St. Brown. The swap of DeVonta Smith for Dallas Goedert balances the deal, as Team B still receives a solid starting TE while Team A maintains a very strong WR corps even after losing their top option."}
