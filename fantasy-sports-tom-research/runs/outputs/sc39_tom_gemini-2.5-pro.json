{"offer_from_A": ["David Njoku", "Courtland Sutton"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Travis Kelce"], "reasoning": "This trade balances both rosters by addressing key needs. Team A has a surplus of quality TEs and WRs and desperately needs a top-tier RB. This deal lands an RB1 in Kenneth Walker III while also upgrading at TE. Team B is exceptionally deep at TE with both Kelce and Sam LaPorta, making Kelce expendable. They leverage this surplus and their RB depth to acquire a much-needed reliable starting WR in Courtland Sutton, fixing their significant lack of depth at the position."}
