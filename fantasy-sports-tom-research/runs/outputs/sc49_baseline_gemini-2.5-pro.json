{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "Team A is trading from a position of incredible running back depth to address its most critical weakness at tight end. With four RBs projected over 14.7 points, we can afford to move a player like Josh Jacobs. Team B has a massive surplus of elite TEs (McBride, Kittle, LaPorta) and can easily spare one to acquire a premier RB1 to pair with Gibbs and Achane. This trade perfectly balances both rosters, providing Team A with a desperately needed top-tier TE while giving Team B an even more dominant RB group."}
