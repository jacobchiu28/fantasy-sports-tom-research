{"offer_from_A": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaxon Smith-Njigba, a high-potential WR, and David Njoku, a solid TE, to acquire Jahmyr Gibbs, a top-tier RB. This trade strengthens Team A's RB position, which is crucial given the high projection of Gibbs, while Team B gains depth in WR and TE positions."}
