{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["Ashton Jeanty"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Baker Mayfield, a high-projection QB, and Chris Godwin, a solid WR, to Team B, which has a need for a stronger QB option given their current QB projections. In return, Team A asks for Ashton Jeanty, a high-projection RB, to bolster their RB lineup. This trade benefits Team A by strengthening their RB position, while Team B gains a QB upgrade and a reliable WR, addressing their QB depth and WR options."}
