{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Mike Evans", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "DeAndre Hopkins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB, WR, and TE for Team B's star RB. Mixon provides a solid RB2, Evans upgrades B's WR corps, and Goedert improves their TE situation. Team B gets three starters for one, addressing multiple positions. Team A significantly upgrades at RB with Robinson, while Hopkins provides WR depth. The trade balances value and addresses needs for both teams, making it appealing for B to consider."}
