{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "George Pickens", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Mike Evans"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher potential than Kamara. Evans provides a strong WR1. Team B gains depth with Kamara, Pickens (young talent), and Hockenson (top TE). B improves TE significantly while maintaining RB strength. Trade balances value and addresses needs for both teams."}
