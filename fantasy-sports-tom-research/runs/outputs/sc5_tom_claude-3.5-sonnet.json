{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Barkley, addressing their need for a high-scoring RB1. London provides a solid WR replacement for Kupp. Team B gains depth at RB with Stevenson and upgrades at WR with Kupp, addressing their WR corps weakness. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both teams."}
