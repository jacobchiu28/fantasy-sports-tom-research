{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "George Pickens", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Jonathan Taylor, a potential elite RB1, while also getting a high-upside WR in Drake London. Team B receives a solid RB2 in James Cook, a promising young WR in George Pickens, and an upgrade at TE with Kyle Pitts Sr. Team B addresses depth at multiple positions while Team A consolidates talent. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional needs, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
