{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Drake London", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Jaylen Waddle", "Sam LaPorta"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's RB and TE positions while maintaining WR strength. Josh Jacobs (15.5) is a significant upgrade over Joe Mixon (8.9). Sam LaPorta (11.2) offers higher upside than Dalton Schultz (7.0). Jaylen Waddle (11.7) for Drake London (15.2) is a slight downgrade, but the overall trade benefits outweigh this."}
