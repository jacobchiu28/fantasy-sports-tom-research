{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Kelce", "Nico Collins"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "rationale": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A acquires a true RB1 in Josh Jacobs to fix its biggest weakness and adds a high-upside WR in JSN. Team B solves its TE problem by acquiring the premier player at the position, Travis Kelce, while also adding a top WR in Nico Collins. Team B can make this move by trading from its deep RB corps."}
