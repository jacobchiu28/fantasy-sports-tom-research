{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Rachaad White"], "ask_from_B": ["Drake London", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a true WR1 in Drake London and a top-tier TE in George Kittle, significantly improving its starting lineup at its two weakest positions. Team B receives a league-winning QB in Lamar Jackson, a massive upgrade over its current options, and adds a reliable RB2 in Rachaad White to bolster its running back corps. It's a mutually beneficial deal that creates two powerhouse teams."}
