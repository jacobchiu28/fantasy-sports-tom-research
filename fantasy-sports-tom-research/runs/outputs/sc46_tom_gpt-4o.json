{"offer_from_A": ["Najee Harris", "Darnell Mooney"], "ask_from_B": ["David Montgomery", "Khalil Shakir"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB position with a more consistent performer in David Montgomery, while also gaining a promising WR in Khalil Shakir to bolster their WR depth. Team B, on the other hand, receives Najee Harris, who has potential upside and can complement their RB lineup, and Darnell Mooney, who can add depth to their WR corps. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A gets a reliable RB and a high-upside WR, while Team B gets a potential breakout RB and additional WR depth."}
