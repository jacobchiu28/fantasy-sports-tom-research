{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "A.J. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Justin Jefferson"], "reasoning": "Team A is deep at QB and can afford to trade Hurts. Upgrading RB with Barkley is crucial. Jefferson is a slight upgrade over Brown at WR. This trade balances Team A's roster while acquiring elite talent at key positions."}
