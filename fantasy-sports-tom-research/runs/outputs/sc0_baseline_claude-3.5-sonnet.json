{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Michael Pittman Jr.", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Cooper Kupp", "Hunter Henry"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall projected points. We upgrade at RB with Achane (17.1) over Taylor (16.2), get a slight boost at WR with Kupp (11.1) over Pittman (10.3), and maintain similar TE production with Henry (8.3) replacing Schultz (7.0). The trade addresses Team B's need for a high-end RB1 in Taylor while providing them with a solid WR2 in Pittman and a comparable TE replacement."}
