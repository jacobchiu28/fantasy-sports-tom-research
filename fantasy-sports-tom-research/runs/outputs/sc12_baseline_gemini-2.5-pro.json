{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Jaylen Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams"], "reasoning": "Team A has a significant weakness at WR and a surplus of talent at TE and RB. This trade sends an elite TE (Mark Andrews) and a solid RB (Jaylen Warren) to address Team B's weakness at TE while also bolstering their RB depth. In return, Team A acquires a true WR1 in Davante Adams to pair with Nico Collins, significantly strengthening its starting lineup. Team A can afford to lose Andrews because it still has the elite Trey McBride."}
