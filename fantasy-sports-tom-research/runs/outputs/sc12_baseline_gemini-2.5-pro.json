{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Terry McLaurin", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "Team A possesses an elite surplus at both RB and TE, with four startable players at each position, while lacking a strong WR2 to pair with A.J. Brown. This trade leverages that depth by sending a high-end RB2 in Josh Jacobs (15.5 proj) and a top-3 TE in Mark Andrews (10.8 proj) to Team B. In return, Team A acquires a legitimate WR1/2 in Terry McLaurin (14.3 proj), filling its biggest need, and a solid RB in D'Andre Swift (11.4 proj) who replaces some of the lost RB production. For Team B, this is a significant upgrade at two positions. They receive a higher-projected RB in Jacobs over Swift and a premier TE in Andrews, a major improvement over Evan Engram (9.7 proj). The trade is balanced by projected points (A gives 26.3, B gives 25.7) and addresses core needs for both rosters."}
