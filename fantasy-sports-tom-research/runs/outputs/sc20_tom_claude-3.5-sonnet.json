{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "David Njoku", "Chase Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A offers elite QB Hurts and top TE Kittle for Jackson, Njoku, and Brown. This trade benefits both teams: A upgrades at RB with Brown while maintaining strong QB play with Jackson, and slightly downgrades at TE but gains depth. B receives a slight QB upgrade and significant TE upgrade in Kittle, addressing their weaker TE position. B has RB depth to spare Brown. The trade is balanced, addressing needs for both teams, making it likely for B to accept."}
