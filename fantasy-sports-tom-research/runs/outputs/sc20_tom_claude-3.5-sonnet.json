{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Terry McLaurin", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Zay Flowers"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB, WR, and TE for a star RB and promising WR. Montgomery and Kittle are solid starters, while McLaurin is a consistent WR. In return, Team A gets Robinson, an elite RB upgrade, and Flowers, a young WR with upside. Team B improves depth across positions, addressing potential weak spots. The trade is balanced, as both teams exchange talent while addressing needs, making it appealing for Team B to accept."}
