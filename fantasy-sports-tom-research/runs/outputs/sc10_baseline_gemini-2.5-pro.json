{"offer_from_A": ["Terry McLaurin", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Rashod Bateman"], "reasoning": "Team A is converting its strong WR depth into a top-tier RB1 to address its primary weakness. Team B has a surplus of elite RBs and needs a reliable WR2 to pair with CeeDee Lamb. This trade provides Team B with Terry McLaurin, a clear upgrade at receiver, and a capable RB2 in Tony Pollard. In exchange, Team A acquires a true workhorse in Jonathan Taylor, significantly raising its weekly ceiling. The projected point values are perfectly balanced, making it a fair and mutually beneficial deal that improves both rosters' starting lineups."}
