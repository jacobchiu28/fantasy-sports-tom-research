{"offer_from_A": ["Kyren Williams", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Brock Bowers", "Joe Mixon"], "rationale": "Team A has an incredible surplus of top-tier running backs but a significant weakness at tight end. This trade sends Team B a legitimate RB1 in Kyren Williams, addressing their biggest roster need. In return, Team A secures the elite tight end they lack in Brock Bowers. Swapping Waller and Mixon helps balance the deal and roster spots, making it a mutually beneficial trade that improves both starting lineups immediately."}
