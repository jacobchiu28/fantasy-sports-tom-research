{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Marquise Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Jaylen Warren", "Matthew Golden"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Marquise Brown to Team B in exchange for Jaylen Warren and Matthew Golden. Team A aims to strengthen its RB position with Jaylen Warren, who has a higher projection than Swift, and add depth to WR with Golden. Team B receives Swift, who is a solid RB option, and Brown, who can bolster their WR lineup. This trade addresses Team B's need for a more balanced WR lineup while maintaining RB strength, making it a fair and mutually beneficial exchange."}
