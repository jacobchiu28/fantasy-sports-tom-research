{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Dak Prescott"], "ask_from_B": ["A.J. Brown", "TreVeyon Henderson"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses the primary needs of both teams. Team A has a surplus of high-end RBs and starting QBs and seeks an elite WR1. Team B has an elite WR corps but lacks reliable RB depth behind Christian McCaffrey. Team A offers an explosive RB in De'Von Achane to create a dominant 1-2 punch for Team B, plus a high-floor QB2 in Dak Prescott. In return, Team A gets the alpha WR it needs in A.J. Brown, while also receiving a high-upside rookie RB in TreVeyon Henderson to replenish depth. This trade balances Team B's roster and consolidates Team A's depth into elite starting talent."}
