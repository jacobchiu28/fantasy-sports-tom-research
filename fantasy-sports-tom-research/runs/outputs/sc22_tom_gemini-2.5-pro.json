{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Tony Pollard"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win addressing both teams' needs by leveraging positional strengths. Team A has elite running back depth (Gibbs, Kyren Williams, Swift) and can afford to move Derrick Henry. In return, they acquire a true top-tier WR in CeeDee Lamb to pair with Tyreek Hill, creating a dominant receiving corps. Team B addresses its two biggest weaknesses: they upgrade from Tony Pollard to a workhorse RB1 in Derrick Henry and, most critically, they solve their massive TE deficit by acquiring the elite Trey McBride. Team B has exceptional WR depth (Nabers, Collins, Ridley) and can easily sustain the loss of Lamb to fortify their roster elsewhere, making this a highly logical and beneficial exchange for them."}
