{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Drake London", "Jake Ferguson"], "rationale": "Team B's biggest needs are RB and TE. This trade provides a massive upgrade at both positions with a top-15 RB (Cook) and a top-10 TE (Goedert). Team A can afford to part with this depth, consolidating talent to acquire a high-end WR1 in London, while taking back a lesser TE in Ferguson to make the positions work. It's a mutually beneficial deal that directly addresses Team B's roster weaknesses."}
