{"offer_from_A": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Lamar Jackson"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at QB with Lamar Jackson, who has a higher projection than Burrow. They also get a younger RB in Bijan Robinson, who has similar projection to McCaffrey but with more long-term upside. Team B receives an elite RB in McCaffrey and a solid QB in Burrow, balancing their roster. This trade is fair in terms of projected points and positional value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
