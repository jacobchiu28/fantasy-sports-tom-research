{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Terry McLaurin"], "reasoning": "Team A trades Derrick Henry (RB) and Jerry Jeudy (WR) for Josh Jacobs (RB) and Terry McLaurin (WR). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with McLaurin (14.3 proj) over Jeudy (12.4 proj), while maintaining strong RB depth. Team B gets Henry, a high-profile RB with similar projection to Jacobs, and Jeudy, a solid WR. Team B likely accepts as they maintain RB strength and add WR depth. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and addresses needs for both teams."}
