{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "reasoning": "Team A has significant RB depth (Walker, Chase Brown) and aims to consolidate assets to acquire a true superstar WR1, which Ja'Marr Chase provides. For Team B, this trade offers a significant upgrade at RB with a workhorse in Josh Jacobs over Rhamondre Stevenson, and adds a high-end WR2 in Tee Higgins who has an established connection with their QB, Joe Burrow. This move balances Team B's roster by strengthening their RB corps while still maintaining a potent receiving threat."}
