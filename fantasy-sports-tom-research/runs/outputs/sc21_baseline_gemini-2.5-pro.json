{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Bowers", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Garrett Wilson", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses key needs for both rosters. Team A has a surplus of elite tight ends and requires a high-end WR2 to complement Tyreek Hill. Garrett Wilson fills this role perfectly, and D'Andre Swift is a slight upgrade over Stevenson. Team B has exceptional WR depth and a significant need for a top-tier TE. This trade allows them to acquire a potential generational talent in Brock Bowers to solve their biggest positional weakness, while leveraging their deep RB and WR corps to facilitate the deal."}
