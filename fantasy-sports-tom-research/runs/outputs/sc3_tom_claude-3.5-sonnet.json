{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "DeAndre Hopkins"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Demarcus Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth at RB for a younger, high-upside RB in Gibbs. Team B gains a proven RB1 in Henry and upgrades at WR with Hopkins. This addresses Team A's need for a dynamic, receiving-capable RB and Team B's desire for a reliable workhorse and WR depth. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both sides."}
