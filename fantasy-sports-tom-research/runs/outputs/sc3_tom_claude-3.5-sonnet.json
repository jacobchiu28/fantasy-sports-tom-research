{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Marquise Brown", "Mike Gesicki"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Tyler Lockett"], "reasoning": "Team A improves RB depth with high-projected Gibbs (17.9) to complement McCaffrey, while adding a solid WR in Lockett. Team B gains RB depth with Chubb, upgrades WR with Brown (10.1 vs Lockett's 6.0), and improves TE with Gesicki. This trade addresses Team B's need for WR improvement and TE depth, while maintaining strong RB corps. Team B likely accepts due to overall value and positional upgrades."}
