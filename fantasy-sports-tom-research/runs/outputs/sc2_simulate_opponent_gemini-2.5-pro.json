{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Bowers"], "ask_from_B": ["TreVeyon Henderson"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite TE depth (Bowers, Kincaid, Pitts) to acquire a desperately needed starting RB. Team B fixes its biggest positional weakness by getting a top-tier TE in Bowers while trading from a position of strength at RB, making this a mutually beneficial deal."}
