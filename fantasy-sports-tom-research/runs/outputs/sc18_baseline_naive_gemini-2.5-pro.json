{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Stefon Diggs"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "Puka Nacua"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's projected points by leveraging its running back depth to acquire two elite wide receivers. Trading away Bijan Robinson (18.5) and Stefon Diggs (10.6) for Ja'Marr Chase (19.5) and Puka Nacua (16.9) results in a net gain of +7.3 projected points per week. This move transforms Team A's primary weakness (WR) into a major strength without significantly compromising the RB position, which remains strong with Josh Jacobs, Ashton Jeanty, and Travis Etienne Jr."}
