{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Miles Sanders", "Diontae Johnson"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Zay Flowers"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB and WR positions by acquiring Josh Jacobs, who has a higher projection than any RB being offered, and Zay Flowers, who has a strong projection and can bolster the WR lineup. Team B receives Nick Chubb and Miles Sanders, who can provide depth at RB, and Diontae Johnson, who can be a solid WR option. This trade balances both teams' needs and improves Team A's starting lineup."}
