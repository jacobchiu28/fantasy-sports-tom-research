{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Tetairoa McMillan"], "rationale": "Team A addresses its critical need for a top WR with McMillan and gets a high-upside RB in Hall by trading from its deep RB and TE positions. Team B receives an elite RB in Taylor to form a dominant duo with Bijan Robinson and gets a massive upgrade at its weakest position, TE, with Dallas Goedert."}
