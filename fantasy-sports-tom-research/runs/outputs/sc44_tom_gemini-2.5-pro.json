{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Michael Wilson"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses the most significant needs for both teams. Team A has an elite surplus at QB and is weak at RB. Team B is weak at QB but has excellent RB depth. Team A trades an elite QB (Lamar Jackson) to solve Team B's biggest problem. In return, Team A gets an elite RB1 (Kyren Williams) to fill its biggest hole, plus a depth WR (Michael Wilson) to balance the projected value. Team B makes a league-winning upgrade at QB and can afford to lose a top RB, as they still have Alvin Kamara, Aaron Jones Sr., and Brian Robinson Jr. It's a classic strength-for-strength trade that makes both teams stronger."}
