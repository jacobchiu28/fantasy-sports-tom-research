{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Jordan Love"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "Team A has significant RB depth and multiple solid QBs but lacks an elite quarterback, which is its biggest need. Team B has a massive surplus of elite QBs but is weaker at RB. This trade provides Team B with a true RB1 in Bijan Robinson and a reliable QB2 in Jordan Love, addressing their main roster weakness. In return, Team A acquires a league-winning QB in Lamar Jackson and a strong RB2 in James Cook to maintain its RB strength, making it a mutually beneficial deal that solves both teams' primary roster imbalances."}
