{"offer_from_A": ["Patrick Mahomes II", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Jaylen Waddle"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its primary need for an elite RB by acquiring De'Von Achane and upgrades its WR corps with Jaylen Waddle. This is achieved by leveraging an incredible strength at QB; trading Patrick Mahomes II is feasible since Baker Mayfield has a nearly identical projection, resulting in a negligible downgrade. For Team B, this trade provides a massive upgrade at QB by acquiring the best player in fantasy football. They can absorb the loss of Achane due to their strong RB depth (James Cook, J.K. Dobbins) and the monumental improvement from C.J. Stroud to Mahomes justifies the cost."}
