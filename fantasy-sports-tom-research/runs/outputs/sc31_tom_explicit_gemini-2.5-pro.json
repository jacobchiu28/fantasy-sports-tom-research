{"offer_from_A": ["Patrick Mahomes II", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams", "James Conner"], "rationale": "Team B receives a significant upgrade at QB with the consensus top fantasy player, Patrick Mahomes, and a reliable RB2 in Tony Pollard. Team A addresses its critical need for a true WR1 in Davante Adams and acquires a strong starting RB in James Conner. This trade allows Team B to consolidate its assets for an elite QB while leveraging its incredible WR depth, and Team A balances its roster by turning its QB surplus into starters at positions of need."}
