{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "Garrett Wilson"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering J.K. Dobbins and Garrett Wilson to acquire Kyren Williams from Team B. This trade aims to strengthen Team A's running back position with a higher projected player, Kyren Williams (15.2), compared to Dobbins (10.9). While losing Wilson (12.6) is a hit to the WR position, Team A has depth with CeeDee Lamb and Zay Flowers. Team B gains a strong WR in Wilson and a solid RB in Dobbins, balancing their roster."}
