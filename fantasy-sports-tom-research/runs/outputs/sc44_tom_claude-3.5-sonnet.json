{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Zay Flowers", "Tyler Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Kyren Williams (15.2 proj) and TE with George Kittle (13.2 proj). Team B gains depth at RB with David Montgomery (11.5 proj), improves at WR with Zay Flowers (13.1 proj), and gets a serviceable TE in Tyler Warren (8.2 proj). This trade addresses Team A's need for a higher-scoring RB and elite TE, while Team B improves WR depth and maintains solid RB and TE options. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
