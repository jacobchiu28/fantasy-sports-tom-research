{"offer_from_A": ["Isiah Pacheco", "Chuba Hubbard"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Austin Ekeler"], "reasoning": "Team A consolidates its significant RB depth to acquire a true WR1, its biggest need. This trade provides Team B with two solid starting RBs, addressing their primary weakness of depth, in exchange for their top WR and a riskier RB asset. The deal improves Team A's starting lineup by adding Nico Collins while Team B strengthens its overall roster stability."}
