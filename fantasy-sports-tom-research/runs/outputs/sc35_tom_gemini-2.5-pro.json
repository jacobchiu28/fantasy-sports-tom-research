{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite WR depth (Adams, Diggs, Metcalf, Thomas Jr.) to acquire a high-volume RB1 in James Conner, solidifying a position of need. Team B has strong RB depth (Conner, Pacheco, Henderson) but lacks a true alpha WR. Adams immediately becomes their WR1, providing an elite target for Justin Herbert. This is a fair, mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's biggest weakness."}
