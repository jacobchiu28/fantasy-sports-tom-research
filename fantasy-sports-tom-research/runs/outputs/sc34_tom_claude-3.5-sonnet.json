{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Allen", "Breece Hall"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "J.J. McCarthy"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Josh Allen (high-value QB) and Breece Hall (solid RB) for Bijan Robinson (elite RB) and J.J. McCarthy (promising QB). This trade benefits Team A by upgrading their RB1 while maintaining QB depth. Team B gains an elite QB in Allen, addressing their need for a top-tier passer, and receives a capable RB in Hall to offset the loss of Robinson. The trade is balanced, as both teams exchange high-value players, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
