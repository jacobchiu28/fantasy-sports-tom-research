{"offer_from_A": ["Breece Hall", "A.J. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Brian Thomas Jr."], "reasoning": "Team A offers Breece Hall (RB) and A.J. Brown (WR) for Christian McCaffrey (RB) and Brian Thomas Jr. (WR). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with CMC, the highest-projected RB. Team B gets a young, high-potential RB in Hall and an elite WR in Brown. Team B has depth at RB and WR to make this trade, while improving their WR corps. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and addresses needs for both teams, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
