{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["Tetairoa McMillan"], "reasoning": "Team A has exceptional RB depth with four other RBs projected over 13.8 points and can afford to move James Cook. The trade shores up Team A's WR corps, adding Tetairoa McMillan as a high-quality depth piece. Team B desperately needs a starting-caliber RB to pair with De'Von Achane, and James Cook immediately becomes their solid RB2. Team B trades from a position of WR depth, where they have multiple similarly projected players, to fix their most significant roster weakness, making this a mutually beneficial deal."}
