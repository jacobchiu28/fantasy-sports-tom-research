{"offer_from_A": ["David Njoku", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Jayden Reed"], "rationale": "Team A trades from its tight end depth and a solid RB to upgrade at the running back position and acquire a promising young receiver. Team B leverages its RB and WR depth to acquire a top-tier TE in Njoku, creating an elite positional duo with Sam LaPorta that offers a significant weekly advantage or future trade flexibility."}
