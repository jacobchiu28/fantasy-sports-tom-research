{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Kelce", "D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Dalton Schultz"], "rationale": "This trade is a classic positional swap that benefits both teams. Team A has an elite TE in Travis Kelce and solid RB depth, allowing them to consolidate assets to acquire a true RB1 stud in Breece Hall. This move significantly raises the ceiling of Team A's running back group. Team B addresses its most glaring weakness, the TE position, by acquiring a league-winner in Kelce. In return, they give up their top RB but receive a very capable replacement in D'Andre Swift, thus solving their TE problem without gutting their RB room."}
