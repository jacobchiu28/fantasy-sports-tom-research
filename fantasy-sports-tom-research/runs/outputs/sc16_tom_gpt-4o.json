{"offer_from_A": ["Tyler Lockett", "Samaje Perine"], "ask_from_B": ["Chuba Hubbard"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Tyler Lockett, a solid WR, and Samaje Perine, a backup RB, to Team B in exchange for Chuba Hubbard. Team A has a surplus of WRs and needs a stronger RB, while Team B has a strong RB lineup and could use more depth at WR. Hubbard's projection is higher than Perine's, making this a fair trade. Team B benefits by gaining a reliable WR and a backup RB, while Team A strengthens its RB position."}
