{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase"], "rationale": "Your WR corps is elite but you're starting RBs projected under 13 points. My roster is the opposite. This trade gives you a true RB1 in Bijan to build around while you still have Nacua, St. Brown, and Higgins at WR. I get the top-tier WR I desperately need. It's a classic strength-for-strength trade that makes both our teams contenders."}
