{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Saquon Barkley"], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts", "Chuba Hubbard"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial blockbuster. Your team gets a massive upgrade at RB by acquiring a top-3 talent in Saquon Barkley to anchor your roster, while still retaining a quality QB1 in Justin Herbert. Our team consolidates assets to acquire an elite QB, which we can do by giving up our RB depth. The projected values are nearly identical, creating a balanced, win-win scenario."}
