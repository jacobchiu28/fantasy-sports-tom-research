{"offer_from_A": ["T.J. Hockenson", "Keon Coleman"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner", "Tyler Higbee"], "rationale": "This trade addresses clear needs for both teams. Team B receives a significant upgrade at its weakest position with a top TE in T.J. Hockenson, and adds a high-upside rookie WR in Keon Coleman. In return, Team A acquires a true RB1 in James Conner by trading from its positions of strength (WR and TE), creating a mutually beneficial deal that leverages your RB depth to fix a major roster hole."}
