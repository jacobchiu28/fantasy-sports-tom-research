{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic strength-for-strength deal that addresses both teams' core needs. Team A has an elite surplus at RB with Gibbs, Taylor, and Jacobs, allowing them to trade a top asset to acquire a high-upside WR1 in Malik Nabers. This creates a dominant young receiving duo with Puka Nacua. Team B's biggest weakness is RB depth behind Derrick Henry. Acquiring Jonathan Taylor immediately solidifies their backfield, turning a weakness into a major strength. They can afford to move Nabers given their other top WRs, Tyreek Hill and DK Metcalf. The trade is balanced by projections and provides a clear win-win path to a championship for both teams."}
