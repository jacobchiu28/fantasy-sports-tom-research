{"offer_from_A": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook", "Tetairoa McMillan"], "reasoning": "Team A trades Gibbs (17.9) and Pittman (10.3) for Cook (14.2) and McMillan (12.4). This trade balances Team A's RB depth while upgrading at WR. Cook provides solid RB production, and McMillan offers higher upside than Pittman. Team B gets a slight upgrade at RB with Gibbs' higher projection."}
