{"offer_from_A": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Josh Reynolds"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Joe Mixon"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade McCaffrey. Acquiring CeeDee Lamb significantly upgrades the WR corps, while Joe Mixon provides solid RB depth. Team B gets an elite RB1 in McCaffrey and a serviceable WR in Reynolds, balancing their roster."}
