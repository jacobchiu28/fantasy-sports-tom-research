{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Zay Flowers", "Cade Otton"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Malik Nabers"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth for top-tier talent. Henry (16.2) is a significant upgrade over Achane (17.1) at RB, while Nabers (16.7) provides elite WR production. Otton (7.7) is expendable with other TEs on roster. This trade improves Team A's starting lineup considerably."}
