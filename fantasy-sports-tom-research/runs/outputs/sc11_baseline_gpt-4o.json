{"offer_from_A": ["Brian Robinson Jr.", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering Brian Robinson Jr. and Jaylen Waddle to acquire Jahmyr Gibbs from Team B. This trade aims to strengthen Team A's running back position with a high-projection player like Gibbs, who has a projection of 17.9, significantly higher than Robinson's 10.4. While Waddle is a strong WR, Team A has depth in the WR position with DeVonta Smith and others, making this trade beneficial for improving the overall team balance."}
