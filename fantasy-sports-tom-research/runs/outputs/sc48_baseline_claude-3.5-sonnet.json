{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "DJ Moore", "Patrick Mahomes II"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Tee Higgins", "Jayden Daniels"], "reasoning": "This trade aims to upgrade Team A's RB1 and WR1 positions while maintaining strong QB performance. McCaffrey is a slight upgrade over Barkley, Higgins offers more consistency than Moore, and Daniels' rushing upside compensates for the loss of Mahomes. Team B gains a elite QB in Mahomes, making this trade mutually beneficial."}
