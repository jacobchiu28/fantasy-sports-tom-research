{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Chris Olave"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "James Cook", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "Trading Bijan Robinson and Chris Olave for CeeDee Lamb, James Cook, and Mark Andrews improves Team A's overall depth and potential. Lamb is a top-tier WR, Cook provides solid RB production, and Andrews significantly upgrades the TE position. This trade balances the loss of Robinson's high projection by acquiring three strong contributors across different positions."}
