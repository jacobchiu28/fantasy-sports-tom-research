{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Puka Nacua"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its significant depth at the QB and TE positions to acquire elite, high-projection starters at RB and WR. This move consolidates talent to maximize the weekly starting lineup's projected score, swapping a top QB and TE for two top-5 skill position players, while retaining strong starters in Justin Herbert and Evan Engram."}
