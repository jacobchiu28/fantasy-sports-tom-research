{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A trades from its immense WR and TE depth to acquire a top-tier, cornerstone RB, which is its most significant roster weakness. Team B capitalizes on its incredible RB depth by trading one stud for two high-quality starters, adding a target-dominant WR1 in Adams and a top-8 TE in Goedert, which strengthens their starting lineup and overall depth significantly."}
