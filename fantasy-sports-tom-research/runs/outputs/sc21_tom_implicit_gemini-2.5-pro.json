{"offer_from_A": ["DeVonta Smith", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Isiah Pacheco", "Jameson Williams"], "rationale": "This addresses clear needs for both rosters. Your team gets a massive upgrade at your weakest position with a top-tier TE in Hockenson and a reliable, high-end WR in Smith. In return, you consolidate your deep RB corps and part with a boom-or-bust WR to create a more balanced starting lineup."}
