{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Tyler Lockett", "Sam LaPorta"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "We're offering a package of high-potential players for Barkley, a top RB, and Collins, an emerging WR. Achane has shown promise but Barkley is more consistent. Lockett and LaPorta are solid, but Collins offers higher upside. This trade improves our RB1 spot significantly while maintaining depth at other positions."}
