{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "Chase Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for a starting RB by leveraging its QB depth. This trade swaps elite QBs with near-identical projections (Hurts 22.0, Jackson 21.6) while providing Team A a significant upgrade at RB with Chase Brown (15.4) over Javonte Williams (8.8). Team B has a massive surplus at both QB and RB, and this move allows them to consolidate two starting assets into the top-projected fantasy QB, while still retaining three elite RBs. It's a mutually beneficial deal that strengthens Team A's starting lineup without creating a new weakness and helps Team B consolidate its talent."}
