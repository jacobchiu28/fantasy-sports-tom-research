{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts", "Tucker Kraft"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades significantly at QB to an elite, week-winning option in Jalen Hurts by trading from its deepest position group. With Brock Bowers still on the roster, parting with George Kittle is a manageable cost. Team B fixes its biggest roster weakness, upgrading from a low-end TE1 in Tucker Kraft to a top-tier TE in Kittle, while still receiving a reliable starting QB in Justin Herbert to replace Hurts. This trade addresses the primary needs of both teams."}
