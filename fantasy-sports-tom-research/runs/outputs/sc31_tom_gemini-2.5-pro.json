{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Christian Kirk"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "C.J. Stroud"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses the primary needs of both teams. Team A has elite QB depth but is weak at WR. Team B has elite WR depth but lacks a top-tier QB. Team B gets a significant upgrade with Lamar Jackson, whose 21.6 projection provides a massive weekly advantage over C.J. Stroud (16.2). Team B can afford to lose Nico Collins due to their strong WR corps featuring Marvin Harrison Jr., Jameson Williams, and Rome Odunze. Team A acquires the true WR1 they need in Nico Collins to pair with Tyreek Hill, creating a formidable receiving duo. While downgrading at QB, C.J. Stroud is still a very capable starter, and Team A maintains excellent depth with Dak Prescott and Justin Fields, resulting in a more balanced and potent overall roster."}
