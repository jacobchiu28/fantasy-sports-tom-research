{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Purdy", "Jonathan Taylor"], "ask_from_B": ["DJ Moore", "Saquon Barkley"], "reasoning": "Team A has elite QB depth but is weak at WR, while Team B has strong WR depth but lacks a top-tier QB. This trade allows Team A to acquire a true WR1 in DJ Moore by leveraging its surplus QB, Brock Purdy. Team B receives a clear QB upgrade and swaps elite RBs (Barkley for Taylor), improving its biggest weakness by trading from a position of strength. The deal is balanced and addresses the primary needs of both rosters, making each team a stronger contender."}
