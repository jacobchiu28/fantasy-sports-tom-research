{"offer_from_A": ["Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "rationale": "Team A addresses its primary need for an elite running back by leveraging its significant depth at wide receiver. Team B receives a premier wide receiver to complement Amon-Ra St. Brown, solidifying a position of relative weakness by trading from its deep pool of high-end running backs. The trade provides a significant positional upgrade for both teams."}
