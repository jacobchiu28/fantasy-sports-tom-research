{"offer_from_A": ["Trey McBride", "Jaylen Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["DK Metcalf", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "rationale": "You get a massive upgrade at your weakest position, acquiring an elite TE in Trey McBride, plus an upgrade at RB with Jaylen Warren. To get it done, you only need to part with DK Metcalf from your deep WR corps and a secondary RB, giving you a better-balanced roster for a championship run."}
