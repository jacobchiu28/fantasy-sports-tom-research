{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Rome Odunze"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Odunze (11.6 proj) over Jeudy (12.4 proj), while maintaining RB strength by swapping Henry (16.2 proj) for Kamara (14.7 proj). Team B gains a slight upgrade at RB with Henry and improves WR depth with Jeudy. The trade addresses Team A's need for WR improvement and Team B's RB depth. It's a fair exchange of talent that balances both teams' rosters, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
