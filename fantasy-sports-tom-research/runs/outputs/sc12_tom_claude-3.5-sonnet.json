{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Michael Wilson"], "ask_from_B": ["Cooper Kupp", "Miles Sanders"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Josh Jacobs (RB, 15.5 proj) and Michael Wilson (WR, 6.9 proj) for Cooper Kupp (WR, 11.1 proj) and Miles Sanders (RB, 4.0 proj). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Kupp, addressing a need for a high-ceiling WR2 behind A.J. Brown. Team B gets a significant RB upgrade with Jacobs, addressing their need for a reliable RB1. Wilson provides WR depth to offset losing Kupp. Sanders is expendable for Team B due to low projection. The trade is balanced in projected points and addresses positional needs for both teams, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
