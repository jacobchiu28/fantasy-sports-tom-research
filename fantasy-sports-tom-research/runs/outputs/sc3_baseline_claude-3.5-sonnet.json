{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "Darius Slayton", "Tyler Higbee"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "DJ Moore"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering depth for star power. Gibbs (17.9 proj) is a significant upgrade over Chubb (4.7 proj) at RB. Moore (13.1 proj) boosts WR corps. Team A can afford to lose Slayton and Higbee due to depth at WR/TE. Trade improves overall projected points for Team A while addressing positional needs."}
