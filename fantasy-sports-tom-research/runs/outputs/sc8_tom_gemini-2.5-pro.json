{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels", "Derrick Henry"], "ask_from_B": ["DJ Moore", "Josh Jacobs"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing key needs. Team B receives a significant QB upgrade in Jayden Daniels, a position of weakness, and a comparable workhorse RB in Derrick Henry. This solves their biggest need by using their WR depth, parting with DJ Moore. Team A leverages its QB depth to acquire a true WR1 in Moore, their biggest need, and an elite RB in Josh Jacobs, creating a more balanced and powerful starting roster."}
