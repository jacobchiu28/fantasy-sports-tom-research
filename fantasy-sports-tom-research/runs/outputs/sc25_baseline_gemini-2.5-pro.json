{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Zay Flowers", "Pat Freiermuth"], "reasoning": "My roster is stacked at RB and TE but lacks a true WR1. This trade allows me to send you depth from my positions of strength for your WR depth. You get a significant TE upgrade in Njoku and a reliable RB2 in Warren, while I get a much-needed high-upside WR in Flowers to lead my receiving corps. It's a mutually beneficial deal that addresses both teams' needs."}
