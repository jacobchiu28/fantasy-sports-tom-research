{"offer_from_A": ["Breece Hall", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase"], "rationale": "Team A aims to consolidate two strong starters into one elite WR1, creating a premier RB/WR duo with McCaffrey and Chase. Team B receives a top RB2 in Hall and a reliable WR1 in McLaurin, adding excellent depth to an already strong roster that can absorb the trade given their existing talent at WR."}
