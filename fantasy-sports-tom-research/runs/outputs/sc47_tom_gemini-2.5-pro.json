{"offer_from_A": ["Jameson Williams", "Jake Ferguson"], "ask_from_B": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Keenan Allen"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs. Team A acquires a top-tier RB2 in Travis Etienne Jr. to fix its biggest roster weakness, leveraging its WR depth by swapping the upside of Williams for the stability of Allen. Team B converts its RB surplus into a significant TE upgrade with Jake Ferguson, who becomes their clear starter, and gets a younger, high-upside WR in Jameson Williams, strengthening two key starting positions."}
