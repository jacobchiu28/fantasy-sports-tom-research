{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Chris Olave"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Drake London (15.2 proj) over Chris Olave (10.9 proj), while maintaining strong RB depth by swapping Henry (16.2 proj) for Kamara (14.7 proj). Team B gains a slight upgrade at RB with Henry and addresses their WR depth issue by acquiring Olave. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional needs, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
