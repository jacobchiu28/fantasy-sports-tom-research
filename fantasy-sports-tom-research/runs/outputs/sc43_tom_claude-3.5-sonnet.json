{"offer_from_A": ["Tyler Allgeier", "Curtis Samuel", "Tyler Higbee"], "ask_from_B": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Pat Freiermuth"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at WR with Smith-Njigba (13.8 proj) and slightly at TE with Freiermuth (7.1 proj). Team B gains RB depth with Allgeier, WR depth with Samuel, and a comparable TE in Higbee. This addresses Team B's RB needs and provides overall depth, while Team A improves key positions. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both teams."}
