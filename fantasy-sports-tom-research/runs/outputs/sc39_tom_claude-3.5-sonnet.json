{"offer_from_A": ["Bucky Irving", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook", "Chris Olave", "Sam LaPorta"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Cook (14.2 proj) over Irving (16.3 proj), while getting a solid WR in Olave (10.9 proj) to replace Smith-Njigba (13.8 proj). LaPorta (11.2 proj) is a slight upgrade over Hockenson (10.7 proj). Team B gets a high-upside RB in Irving, a promising young WR in Smith-Njigba, and a proven TE in Hockenson. This trade balances both teams' rosters and provides potential for growth. Team B is likely to accept as they receive three talented players with high ceilings, addressing their need for RB depth and WR potential."}
