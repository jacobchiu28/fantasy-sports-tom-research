{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Curtis Samuel", "Michael Mayer"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB/WR/TE for a star RB. Team B gains three solid players to address depth concerns, especially at WR and TE. Robinson's high projection (18.5) is offset by the combined value of Jones (11.5), Samuel (4.0), and Mayer (4.0). This trade allows Team B to spread risk and fill multiple roster spots, while Team A consolidates value into a top-tier RB. Team B likely accepts due to improved overall roster flexibility and depth."}
