{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Brock Bowers", "Chase Brown"], "rationale": "This trade leverages Team A's running back depth to acquire an elite tight end and a high-projection running back. Upgrading from Darren Waller (7.2) to Brock Bowers (14.4) is a massive improvement at a weak position, while swapping Aaron Jones Sr. (11.5) for Chase Brown (15.4) also results in a point increase, leading to a significant overall gain in projected points for Team A."}
