{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Cooper Kupp", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Barkley (19.3 proj) while addressing Team B's TE need with Andrews. Kupp for Collins is a fair WR swap. Team B improves depth at RB and WR, gains a top TE. Trade balances value and addresses needs for both teams."}
