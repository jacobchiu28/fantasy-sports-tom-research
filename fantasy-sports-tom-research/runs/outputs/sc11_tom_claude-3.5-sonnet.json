{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "DeVonta Smith"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Terry McLaurin"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Gibbs (17.9 proj vs 19.3) while maintaining WR strength. Team B gets a proven RB1 in Barkley and upgrades at WR with Smith. Fair value exchange addressing needs for both teams."}
