{"offer_from_A": ["Marvin Harrison Jr.", "James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "Team A consolidates a high-upside rookie WR and a solid RB to acquire an elite, top-tier RB in De'Von Achane, significantly raising its weekly ceiling. Team B addresses its critical lack of a WR1 with Marvin Harrison Jr. and receives a quality starting RB in James Cook to fix its poor depth, making this a mutually beneficial deal that solves each team's primary roster weakness."}
