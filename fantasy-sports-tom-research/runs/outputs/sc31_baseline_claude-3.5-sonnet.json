{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Chris Godwin", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Drake London", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall projected points. We upgrade at RB with Barkley (19.3) over Taylor (16.2), significantly boost WR with London (15.2) over Godwin (4.8), and improve TE with Kittle (13.2) over Waller (7.2). Team B gets a solid RB and potential upside in Godwin and Waller."}
