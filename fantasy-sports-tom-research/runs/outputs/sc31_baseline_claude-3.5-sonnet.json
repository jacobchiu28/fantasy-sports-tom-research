{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Herbert", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "This trade aims to upgrade Team A's WR corps while maintaining QB strength. Nico Collins (15.9 proj) is a significant upgrade over Waddle (11.7 proj). Herbert (16.6 proj) is comparable to Jackson (21.6 proj), but with less injury risk. This trade balances Team A's roster and capitalizes on Team B's WR depth."}
