{"offer_from_A": ["Dalton Kincaid", "Zay Flowers"], "ask_from_B": ["TreVeyon Henderson", "Jerry Jeudy"], "rationale": "Team A addresses its critical need for a starting RB with TreVeyon Henderson while trading from its TE depth with Dalton Kincaid. Team B receives a significant TE upgrade in Kincaid, their weakest position, and a dynamic young receiver in Zay Flowers, by trading from their deep RB and WR corps. This is a win-win, solving key roster needs for both teams."}
