{"offer_from_A": ["Puka Nacua", "Sam LaPorta"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "T.J. Hockenson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Puka Nacua (WR, 16.9 proj) and Sam LaPorta (TE, 11.2 proj) for Jonathan Taylor (RB, 16.2 proj) and T.J. Hockenson (TE, 10.7 proj). This trade benefits both teams: A gets a high-scoring RB to complement Ekeler and still has strong WRs, while B improves at WR and maintains TE strength. B likely accepts due to Nacua's high projection and their WR need."}
