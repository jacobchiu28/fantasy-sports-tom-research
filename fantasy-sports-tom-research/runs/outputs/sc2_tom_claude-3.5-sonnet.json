{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Marquise Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane (high-potential RB) and Michael Pittman Jr. (solid WR) for Derrick Henry (elite RB) and Marquise Brown (WR with upside). This trade benefits Team A by acquiring a top RB in Henry, addressing their RB depth issue. Team B gains a promising young RB in Achane and upgrades at WR with Pittman. The trade is balanced, as both teams address needs: Team A improves their RB situation, while Team B gets younger at RB and stronger at WR. Team B is likely to accept due to Henry's age and the potential of Achane, plus the WR upgrade."}
