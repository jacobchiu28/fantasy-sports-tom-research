{"offer_from_A": ["A.J. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "rationale": "This is a win-win trade addressing both teams' primary needs. Team A has a surplus of elite WRs but is weak at RB. Team B has a surplus of strong RBs but needs a true WR1. This deal sends a top-tier receiver in A.J. Brown to become the cornerstone of Team B's passing game, while Team A acquires an elite RB1 in Kyren Williams to solve its biggest roster hole. The projected values are nearly identical, making it a fair swap that significantly improves both teams."}
