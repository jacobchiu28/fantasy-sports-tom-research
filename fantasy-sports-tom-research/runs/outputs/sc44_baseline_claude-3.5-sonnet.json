{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Zay Flowers", "Jalen Hurts"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Marvin Harrison Jr.", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We upgrade at RB with Williams (15.2 proj vs Montgomery's 11.5), get a top WR in Harrison Jr. (13.3 proj), and significantly improve at TE with Kittle (13.2 proj). We can afford to trade Hurts due to having Jackson and Maye as strong QB options."}
