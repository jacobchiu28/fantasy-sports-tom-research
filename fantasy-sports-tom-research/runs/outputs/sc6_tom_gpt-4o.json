{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen their RB position with a high-projection player like Josh Jacobs, who has a projection of 15.5. Team B, on the other hand, could benefit from acquiring Rhamondre Stevenson, who has a solid projection of 10.3, and Chris Godwin, a reliable WR with a projection of 4.8, to bolster their WR depth. This trade offers Team B a balanced improvement across RB and WR positions, while Team A gains a top-tier RB to enhance their lineup. The trade is fair and addresses both teams' needs, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
