{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Jalen McMillan"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Jalen McMillan to Team B in exchange for Derrick Henry. Team A strengthens their RB position with a high-projection player, Derrick Henry, who has a 16.2 projection. Team B receives D'Andre Swift, a solid RB with an 11.4 projection, and Jalen McMillan, a WR with a 9.2 projection, which helps balance their WR depth. This trade is beneficial for Team B as they gain depth in both RB and WR positions, addressing their need for more versatile options, while Team A consolidates their RB strength with a top-tier player."}
