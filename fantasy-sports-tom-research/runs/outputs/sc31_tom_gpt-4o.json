{"offer_from_A": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba", "Cameron Ward"], "ask_from_B": ["George Kittle", "Austin Ekeler"], "reasoning": "Team A strengthens its TE position with George Kittle, a top-tier option, and gains depth at RB with Austin Ekeler, who has a higher projection than most of Team A's RBs. Team B receives Jaxon Smith-Njigba, a promising WR to bolster their WR depth, and Cameron Ward, a solid QB option, addressing their need for a backup QB with potential upside. This trade balances both teams' needs and offers fair value."}
