{"offer_from_A": ["C.J. Stroud", "D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Jayden Reed"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its incredible QB depth to acquire an elite, desperately needed RB. C.J. Stroud is a massive upgrade for Team B's weakest position (QB), and D'Andre Swift provides a solid RB replacement. In return, Team A lands a top-tier RB in Bijan Robinson to anchor its weak backfield and gets a quality WR in Jayden Reed to maintain depth. This trade addresses the primary needs of both teams by exchanging from a position of strength for a position of weakness."}
