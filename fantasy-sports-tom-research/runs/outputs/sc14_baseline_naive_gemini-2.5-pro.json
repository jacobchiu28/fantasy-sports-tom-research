{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Chris Godwin", "T.J. Hockenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Bucky Irving", "Xavier Worthy", "Ladd McConkey"], "rationale": "This trade massively increases Team A's projected points by targeting Team B's highest projected players at positions of need (WR and RB). We acquire elite prospects in Bucky Irving, Xavier Worthy, and Ladd McConkey (total proj: 45.8) while giving up an underperforming RB, a low-projection WR, and a redundant TE in T.J. Hockenson, who is blocked by the elite Trey McBride (total proj: 26.2). This results in a significant net gain of 19.6 projected points for Team A."}
