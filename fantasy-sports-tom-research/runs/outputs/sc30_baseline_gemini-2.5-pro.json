{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Rome Odunze"], "ask_from_B": ["A.J. Brown", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of startable RBs but desperately needs a WR1, while Team B is overloaded with elite RBs. This trade provides Team A its needed WR1 in A.J. Brown by packaging an elite RB and a high-upside rookie. Team B consolidates its RB depth by acquiring a workhorse back in Henry and a promising rookie, making it a fair, balanced deal that addresses both teams' needs."}
