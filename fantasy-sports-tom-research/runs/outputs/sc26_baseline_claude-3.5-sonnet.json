{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tyreek Hill", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "We're offering a package of high-value players across different positions to acquire two elite performers. Barkley is a significant upgrade over Ekeler at RB, while Chase is comparable to Hill but with higher upside. We're including McBride to sweeten the deal, as we have depth at TE. This trade improves our starting lineup without depleting our depth too severely."}
