{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Ja'Marr Chase"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "CeeDee Lamb", "Joe Burrow"], "reasoning": "Trading two high-value players for three elite performers. Upgrading at QB with Burrow while maintaining strong WR corps and RB depth. St. Brown and Lamb offer consistent high projections, balancing the loss of Chase. Team A can afford to trade Robinson due to strong RB depth."}
