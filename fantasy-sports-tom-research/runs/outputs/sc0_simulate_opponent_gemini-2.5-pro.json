{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Malik Nabers"], "rationale": "This is a blockbuster swap targeting roster balance. Team A has elite QB depth but needs a true RB1, while Team B is loaded at RB but needs a top-tier QB. Lawrence for Henry is the core of the deal, addressing both teams' primary needs. Swapping high-upside young WRs in Smith-Njigba and Nabers makes it a more dynamic trade that gives both teams a different flavor of elite prospect to build around."}
