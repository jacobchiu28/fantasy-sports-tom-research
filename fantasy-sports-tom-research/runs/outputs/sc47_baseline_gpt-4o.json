{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "DeAndre Hopkins"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB position with a high-projection player. Offering J.K. Dobbins and DeAndre Hopkins, who have decent projections, for Kyren Williams, who has a higher projection than both, improves Team A's RB depth. Team B gains a WR to balance their roster and a potential high-upside RB in Dobbins."}
