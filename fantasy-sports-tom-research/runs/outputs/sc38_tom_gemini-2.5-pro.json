{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "C.J. Stroud"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses both teams' primary needs by balancing rosters. Team A has an abundance of elite RBs and QBs but lacks a true WR1. Team B has a top-tier WR in Amon-Ra St. Brown but is weak at RB and could use a QB upgrade. Team A sends Josh Jacobs, an elite RB1, and C.J. Stroud, a top young QB, to immediately upgrade two of Team B's starting positions. In return, Team A acquires the elite WR1 they desperately need in Amon-Ra St. Brown. This is a mutually beneficial trade where Team A consolidates its depth into a stud WR, and Team B significantly strengthens its RB and QB positions, making both teams stronger overall."}
