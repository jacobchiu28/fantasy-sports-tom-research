{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "David Montgomery"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth by trading Lamar Jackson to solve Team B's biggest weakness. In return, Team A acquires a high-upside RB1 in Breece Hall and a young alpha WR in Drake London, consolidating talent to improve its starting lineup significantly while still rostering Josh Allen. Team B gets a massive, weekly game-changing upgrade at QB and a reliable RB2 in Montgomery."}
