{"offer_from_A": ["A.J. Brown", "Tua Tagovailoa", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Travis Kelce"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's projected weekly score by acquiring an elite RB1 in Kyren Williams and the undisputed top TE in Travis Kelce. This addresses Team A's biggest roster weaknesses by leveraging its immense depth at WR and QB, offloading a redundant top-tier QB and a starting WR for massive positional upgrades."}
