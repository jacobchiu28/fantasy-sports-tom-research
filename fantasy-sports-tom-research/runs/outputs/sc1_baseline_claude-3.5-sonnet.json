{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Christian Kirk"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Jerome Ford"], "reasoning": "Team A trades away Derrick Henry (16.2) and Christian Kirk (7.8) for CeeDee Lamb (17.4) and Jerome Ford (9.0). This trade improves Team A's WR corps significantly with Lamb, while only slightly downgrading at RB. Ford provides solid RB depth. Team B gets a strong RB1 in Henry and a reliable WR in Kirk, addressing their needs."}
