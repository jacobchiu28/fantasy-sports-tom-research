{"offer_from_A": ["Nick Chubb", "DeVonta Smith", "Justin Fields"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Henry (16.2 proj vs Chubb's 4.7) and WR with Lamb (17.4 proj vs Smith's 13.0). Fields (15.8 proj) is expendable due to Josh Allen (21.8 proj). This trade improves Team A's overall projected points while addressing positional needs."}
