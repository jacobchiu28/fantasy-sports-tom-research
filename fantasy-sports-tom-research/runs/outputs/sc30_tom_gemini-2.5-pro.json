{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "James Conner"], "ask_from_B": ["A.J. Brown", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing key needs by leveraging positional strengths. Team A has elite QB depth with Burrow, Prescott, and Stafford but is critically weak at WR. They also have a strong RB room. This trade sends their top QB and a solid RB to acquire a true WR1 in A.J. Brown, solving their biggest roster hole, and a comparable RB in James Cook. Team A can still comfortably start Dak Prescott. Team B has an incredible surplus of top-tier RBs but can upgrade from their good QB room to an elite one with Joe Burrow. They trade from their deepest position (RB) and their WR1 to gain a top-5 QB, a significant positional advantage, while still rostering an elite RB corps in Gibbs, Bijan, and Achane."}
