{"offer_from_A": ["Bucky Irving", "Jayden Reed"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Bucky Irving, a high-projection RB, and Jayden Reed, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson, a top-tier RB. Team A has depth at WR and can afford to lose Reed, while Team B gains a strong RB and a reliable WR, addressing their need for WR depth. This trade balances Team B's roster by strengthening their WR position without significantly weakening their RB lineup, making it a fair and mutually beneficial exchange."}
