{"offer_from_A": ["Terry McLaurin", "Jaylen Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride"], "rationale": "Your roster is elite at TE with both McBride and Bowers but could use a top-tier WR. This deal lands you Terry McLaurin to be your WR1 and a strong RB2/Flex in Jaylen Warren. You're turning a redundant TE, who you can't start, into two high-quality weekly starters at positions of need, significantly improving your lineup's strength and depth."}
