{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Isaiah Likely"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its primary weakness at WR and TE by trading from its significant QB depth. Acquiring Tyreek Hill and Mark Andrews creates an elite starting lineup alongside CeeDee Lamb. Team B solves its most glaring need by acquiring an elite, top-projected QB in Lamar Jackson, which is a massive upgrade over their current options. They also receive Jackson's handcuff TE, making this a mutually beneficial blockbuster trade that solidifies both teams as contenders."}
