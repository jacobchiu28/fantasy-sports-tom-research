{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Drake Maye"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "This trade leverages our respective roster strengths for a mutual benefit. I have significant depth at RB and QB, making Taylor and the high-upside Maye available. In return, I get a top rookie WR in Nabers to build a dominant young corps with Puka Nacua and an elite TE in McBride. You get to consolidate your TE surplus (since you can't start both McBride and Kelce) into a potential franchise QB and swap a promising but unproven rookie for a true workhorse RB in Taylor, creating a formidable duo with Derrick Henry."}
