{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson", "Jayden Reed"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to significantly upgrade at TE with McBride and add another top-tier RB in Taylor, consolidating value into the starting lineup. Team B addresses its weak QB2 and WR positions with an elite QB and a solid WR, trading from positions of strength with their RB depth (Jacobs, Conner) and TE depth (Kincaid)."}
