{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a high-value RB, and Dalton Schultz, a solid TE, to acquire Jahmyr Gibbs, a top-performing RB with a higher projection. This trade strengthens Team A's RB position with a younger, high-upside player while Team B receives a proven RB and a TE to bolster their lineup."}
