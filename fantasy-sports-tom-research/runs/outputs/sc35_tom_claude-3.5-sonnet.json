{"offer_from_A": ["Patrick Mahomes II", "Travis Etienne Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts", "James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A offers a slight QB downgrade but gains a higher-projected RB. Team B upgrades at QB while maintaining RB depth. Both teams address needs: A improves RB corps, B gets elite QB. Fair value exchange makes acceptance likely."}
