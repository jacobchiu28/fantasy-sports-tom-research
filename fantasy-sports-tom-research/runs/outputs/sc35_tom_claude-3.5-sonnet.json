{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Josh Reynolds"], "ask_from_B": ["Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade Montgomery. Team B needs RB help, with Montgomery being an upgrade over some of their current options. Smith-Njigba would significantly improve Team A's WR corps. Reynolds is included to balance the trade and give Team B WR depth. This trade addresses needs for both teams and is likely to be accepted due to its mutual benefits."}
