{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Keenan Allen", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Cooper Kupp", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall projected points. We're trading Barkley (19.3) for Hall (12.7), a slight downgrade but still a solid RB. We upgrade at WR with Kupp (11.1) over Allen (9.1), and get a higher-projected TE in McBride (14.6) compared to Kittle (13.2). This trade balances our roster while potentially increasing our weekly point total."}
