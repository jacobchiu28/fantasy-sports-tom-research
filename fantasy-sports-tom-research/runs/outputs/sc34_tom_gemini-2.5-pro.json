{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Allen", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a top-tier RB and WR, fundamentally improving its starting lineup while still rostering Patrick Mahomes. Team B consolidates its incredible RB/WR depth to acquire the consensus #1 fantasy QB, creating a massive weekly advantage at the most important position while still retaining elite talent like Bijan Robinson and DJ Moore. This is a mutually beneficial 'stud-for-studs' trade where both teams upgrade positions of need by trading from positions of strength."}
