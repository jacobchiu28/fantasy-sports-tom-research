{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "Rachaad White"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "Chase Brown"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its significant QB depth to acquire a high-end WR1 in Tee Higgins and a strong RB2 in Chase Brown, addressing its biggest needs. Team B receives a proven, elite QB in Joe Burrow to solve its main weakness, and can easily absorb the loss of Higgins and Brown due to its incredible depth at WR and RB."}
