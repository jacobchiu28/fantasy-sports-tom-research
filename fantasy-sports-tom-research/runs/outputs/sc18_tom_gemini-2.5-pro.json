{"offer_from_A": ["Michael Pittman Jr.", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Bucky Irving"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial consolidation trade. Team A upgrades its RB position by trading two solid starters for a single player with a higher ceiling in Bucky Irving, addressing its need for an elite RB. Team B, rich with young RB talent, capitalizes on Irving's value by acquiring two proven starters. Michael Pittman Jr. provides elite depth to their top-heavy WR corps, and Brian Robinson Jr. adds a reliable veteran presence to their RB room, making their roster deeper and less risky."}
