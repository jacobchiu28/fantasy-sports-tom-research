{"offer_from_A": ["Jordan Love", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Travis Kelce"], "reasoning": "My team has incredible depth at QB and TE but is weak at WR. This trade leverages our surplus to address our primary need. I'm offering a top QB in Jordan Love, whom I can afford to move with Hurts and Mayfield on my roster, and a top-10 TE in David Njoku, as I still have LaPorta, Engram, and Goedert. In return, I acquire a true WR1 in Nico Collins to anchor my receiving corps and the legendary Travis Kelce. This deal is a win-win: I get my much-needed WR1, and you receive a significant QB upgrade and an elite TE to pair with your existing depth, consolidating from your position of WR strength."}
