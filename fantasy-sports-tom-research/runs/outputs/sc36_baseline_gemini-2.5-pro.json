{"offer_from_A": ["Drake London", "Baker Mayfield"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for a starting RB by trading from its positions of strength (WR and QB). Team B is stacked at RB but lacks a reliable WR3, so it acquires a high-end talent in Drake London and a quality backup QB, while being able to afford moving a top RB."}
