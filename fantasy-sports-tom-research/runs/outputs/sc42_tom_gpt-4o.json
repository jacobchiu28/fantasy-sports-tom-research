{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Zay Flowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Zay Flowers to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson. Team A strengthens their RB position with a top-tier player, Bijan Robinson, addressing their need for a high-projection RB. Team B receives D'Andre Swift, a solid RB, and Zay Flowers, a high-projection WR, enhancing their WR depth and maintaining RB strength. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B gains depth and potential in both RB and WR positions, while Team A secures a top RB."}
