{"offer_from_A": ["Garrett Wilson", "Sam LaPorta"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Darren Waller"], "rationale": "This trade addresses clear needs for both teams by swapping A's depth at WR/TE for B's elite RB talent. Team A acquires a cornerstone RB in Jahmyr Gibbs to solidify its weakest position, while getting a usable TE back in Darren Waller. Team B receives a significant upgrade at two positions, landing a potential WR1 in Garrett Wilson and an elite TE in Sam LaPorta, capitalizing on their running back surplus to build a more balanced championship contender."}
