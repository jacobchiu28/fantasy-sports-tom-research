{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for a top-tier WR by trading from its immense QB and RB depth. Parting with Baker Mayfield and Brian Robinson Jr. is manageable given Patrick Mahomes II, Tua Tagovailoa, Josh Jacobs, and James Conner remain on the roster. Team B receives a significant QB upgrade in Mayfield, who provides elite insurance for Jalen Hurts, and a reliable RB2 in Robinson to bolster a top-heavy backfield. The trade is balanced by projected points and allows both teams to convert roster surplus into starters at positions of need."}
