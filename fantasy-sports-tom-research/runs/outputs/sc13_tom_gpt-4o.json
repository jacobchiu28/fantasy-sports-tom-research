{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Jameson Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Austin Ekeler and Tyler Lockett to Team B in exchange for Alvin Kamara and Jameson Williams. This trade benefits Team A by upgrading their RB position with Kamara, who has a higher projection than Ekeler, and acquiring Williams, a promising WR with a similar projection to Lockett but with potentially higher upside. Team B benefits by receiving Ekeler, who can provide depth and stability to their RB lineup, and Lockett, who can immediately contribute to their WR corps. The trade addresses Team B's need for a more balanced roster while maintaining competitive projections."}
