{"offer_from_A": ["Chuba Hubbard", "DJ Moore"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Chuba Hubbard and DJ Moore to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson. Team A aims to strengthen their RB position with a high-projection player like Robinson, while Team B receives a solid RB in Hubbard and a strong WR in Moore, addressing their need for WR depth. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B has a surplus of RBs and can afford to trade Robinson for a balanced improvement in both RB and WR positions."}
