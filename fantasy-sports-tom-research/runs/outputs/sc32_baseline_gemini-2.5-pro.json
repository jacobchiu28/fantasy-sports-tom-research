{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels", "Derrick Henry"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Zay Flowers"], "reasoning": "My roster is deep at QB and solid at RB but lacks an elite young RB and a clear WR1. This trade allows me to consolidate my assets to acquire a top-tier young RB in Bijan Robinson and a high-upside WR in Zay Flowers. For you, this trade solidifies your QB room with an elite rookie prospect in Jayden Daniels and adds a proven, high-volume veteran RB in Derrick Henry to your already deep RB corps, giving you a powerful win-now piece without sacrificing significant future value."}
