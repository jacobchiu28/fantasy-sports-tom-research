{"offer_from_A": ["Jerome Ford", "Jaylen Warren", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Chris Olave"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and WR, allowing us to package Ford, Warren, and Kupp for an upgrade. Gibbs offers higher projected points (17.9) than any RB we're trading away, while Olave (10.9) nearly matches Kupp's projection (11.1) with potential for growth. This trade improves our starting lineup without significantly weakening our depth."}
