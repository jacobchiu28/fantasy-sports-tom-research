{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "Jayden Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "reasoning": "Team A offers J.K. Dobbins and Jayden Higgins to Team B in exchange for Kyren Williams. Team A strengthens its RB position with a higher projected player in Kyren Williams, addressing a need for a more reliable RB option. Team B receives J.K. Dobbins, who has a decent projection and potential upside, along with Jayden Higgins, adding depth to their WR position, which is slightly weaker compared to their RB depth. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B gains depth and potential in both RB and WR positions, while Team A upgrades their RB position with a higher projected player."}
