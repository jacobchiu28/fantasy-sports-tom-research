{"offer_from_A": ["Breece Hall", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["James Cook", "Keon Coleman"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Cook (14.2 proj) over Hall (12.7 proj), addressing their need for a higher-scoring RB2. Team B gets a potential breakout RB in Hall and upgrades at WR with Pittman (10.3 proj) over Coleman (10.0 proj). This trade balances both teams' rosters, giving Team B a strong RB prospect and reliable WR, while Team A improves their starting lineup. The projections are close enough that Team B should find this trade appealing, especially if they believe in Hall's upside."}
