{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Ja'Marr Chase", "David Njoku"], "rationale": "This trade leverages Team A's significant QB depth by dealing Joe Burrow (20.0 proj) to acquire an elite WR in Ja'Marr Chase (19.5 proj) and a top-tier TE in David Njoku (10.6 proj). The total projection gained (30.1) far exceeds the projection lost (28.0), resulting in a powerful upgrade to the starting lineup while retaining Josh Allen as the QB1."}
