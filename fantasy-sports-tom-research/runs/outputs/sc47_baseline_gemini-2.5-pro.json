{"offer_from_A": ["Nico Collins", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Jakobi Meyers"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's primary weakness. Team A needs a true RB1, and Team B needs a strong WR2 to pair with Ja'Marr Chase. Team A offers Nico Collins, a top-tier WR, to solve Team B's receiver depth issue. Rhamondre Stevenson is included as a capable starting RB to replace some of the production Team B is sending away. In return, Team A gets its much-needed workhorse back in Jonathan Taylor and receives a solid WR in Jakobi Meyers to backfill the roster spot. This trade balances both rosters and improves both starting lineups."}
