{"offer_from_A": ["Mark Andrews", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win, addressing each team's primary needs by trading from a position of surplus. Team A has two elite TEs and deep RBs, allowing them to move Mark Andrews and Rhamondre Stevenson to acquire a top-tier WR in Nico Collins, creating a formidable WR corps with Tyreek Hill. Team B has incredible WR depth but a major weakness at TE and lacks RB depth. They upgrade significantly by acquiring an elite TE in Mark Andrews and bolster their thin RB corps with a reliable starter in Rhamondre Stevenson. Team B can absorb the loss of one WR to fix their two biggest roster holes, creating a more balanced and powerful lineup."}
