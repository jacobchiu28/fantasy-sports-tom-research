{"offer_from_A": ["Kyler Murray", "DeVonta Smith"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Herbert", "Jahmyr Gibbs"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's biggest need from a position of strength. Team A has a QB surplus (Murray, Prescott, Stroud) and needs an elite RB. Team B has an RB surplus (Gibbs, Jacobs, Henderson) and needs an elite QB. Team A gets its star RB in Gibbs, while the QB downgrade to Herbert is easily covered by its depth. Team B gets a significant upgrade at their weakest position with Murray by dealing from their deepest, and also acquires a strong WR in Smith."}
