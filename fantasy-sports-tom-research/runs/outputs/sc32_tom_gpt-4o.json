{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Adam Thielen"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a high-value RB, and Adam Thielen, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson. Team B receives a strong RB to replace Robinson and a reliable WR to bolster their receiving corps, addressing their need for WR depth. Team A upgrades their RB position with Robinson, who has a higher projection than Henry, while maintaining depth at WR. This trade is mutually beneficial as it strengthens Team B's WR lineup and provides Team A with a top-tier RB."}
