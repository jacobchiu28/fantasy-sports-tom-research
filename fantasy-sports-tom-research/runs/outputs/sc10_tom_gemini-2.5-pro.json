{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Xavier Worthy"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Jayden Reed"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial. Team A consolidates two strong assets to acquire an undisputed top-tier RB in Saquon Barkley, upgrading its ceiling, while receiving a reliable WR2/3 in Jayden Reed. Team A can afford this trade due to its exceptional RB depth. Team B addresses its critical weakness at wide receiver by acquiring Xavier Worthy, a high-upside rookie who immediately improves their starting lineup. While downgrading from Barkley to Derrick Henry, they still retain an elite RB1 and significantly bolster their weak receiving corps, creating a more balanced roster. This move makes sense for Team B as it directly solves their biggest positional need."}
