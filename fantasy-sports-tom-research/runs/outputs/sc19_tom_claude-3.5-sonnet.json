{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Chris Godwin", "Evan Engram"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Achane (17.1 proj) over Etienne (10.0 proj) and gets a WR upgrade with Ridley (11.8 proj) over Godwin (4.8 proj). Team B gains depth at TE with Engram (9.7 proj) and improves WR depth with Godwin. Etienne provides a solid RB option for Team B. This trade addresses Team A's need for higher-scoring RB and WR, while giving Team B more depth and potential upside. Team B likely accepts due to balanced value and positional improvements."}
