{"offer_from_A": ["Lamar Jackson"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "Team A is leveraging its extraordinary QB depth to address its two biggest weaknesses. By trading the top QB, Lamar Jackson, we acquire an elite workhorse RB in Derrick Henry to create a formidable backfield with De'Von Achane, and a top-tier TE in Dallas Goedert. This move is possible because Kyler Murray remains a high-end starting QB. Team B receives a massive, league-winning upgrade at QB and can afford to move Goedert as they still have Kyle Pitts Sr."}
