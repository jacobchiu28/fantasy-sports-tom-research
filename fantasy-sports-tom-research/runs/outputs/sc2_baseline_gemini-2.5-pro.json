{"offer_from_A": ["Dak Prescott", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Ricky Pearsall"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its need for a true RB1 by trading from its deep QB and WR positions. Team B has an abundance of elite RBs but is desperately thin at WR. This trade provides Team B with a quality starting QB in Dak Prescott and a high-upside WR2 in George Pickens. In return, Team A secures an elite RB in Jonathan Taylor, instantly upgrading its weakest starting spot, and acquires a promising rookie WR in Ricky Pearsall to backfill its roster. The trade is mutually beneficial, solving the primary roster construction problem for both teams."}
