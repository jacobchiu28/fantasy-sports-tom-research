{"offer_from_A": ["David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Michael Pittman Jr."], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as it addresses each team's primary need by trading from a position of surplus. Team A has an abundance of top-tier TEs (LaPorta, Engram, Njoku) and is desperate for a starting WR. By trading David Njoku, Team A still retains two elite TEs while acquiring Michael Pittman Jr., who immediately becomes a top WR on their roster. Team B strengthens its biggest weakness, TE depth behind Travis Kelce. They get an elite TE2 in Njoku, providing a high-end weekly flex option and crucial injury/bye week insurance. They can afford to part with Pittman Jr. given their strong WR corps that still includes Nico Collins, Jakobi Meyers, and Keenan Allen. The projected values are nearly identical, making it a fair and logical deal for both sides."}
