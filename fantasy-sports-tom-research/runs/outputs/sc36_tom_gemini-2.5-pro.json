{"offer_from_A": ["Drake London", "Rachaad White"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Romeo Doubs"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial. Team A desperately needs an RB1 and gets a significant upgrade in Josh Jacobs, addressing its biggest weakness. Team B has incredible RB depth (McCaffrey, Robinson, Pollard) and can easily afford to part with Jacobs to address its lack of a reliable third WR. Drake London immediately becomes a high-end WR3 for Team B, forming an elite receiving corps with Chase and St. Brown. Rachaad White replaces Jacobs as a quality depth piece for Team B, while Romeo Doubs is a reasonable return to balance the deal."}
