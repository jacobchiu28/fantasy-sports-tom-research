{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift", "Jauan Jennings"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A offers D'Andre Swift and Jauan Jennings to acquire Derrick Henry from Team B. Swift and Jennings have solid projections, but Henry's higher projection and consistent performance make him a valuable asset for Team A's RB lineup. This trade strengthens Team A's RB position significantly, while Team B receives depth with a strong WR and a reliable RB."}
