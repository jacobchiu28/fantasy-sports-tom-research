{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Rashee Rice"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB position with a more consistent performer. Joe Mixon has underperformed, and Rashee Rice is expendable given Team A's WR depth. James Conner offers a solid upgrade at RB with a higher projection, improving Team A's starting lineup."}
