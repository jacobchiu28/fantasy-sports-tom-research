{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Chuba Hubbard"], "rationale": "Your QB room is top-heavy with Josh Allen and could use a more reliable QB2. This trade lands you Baker Mayfield, a high-end QB2 who provides a significant upgrade over your current backups for bye weeks and insurance. You have excellent RB depth with Kamara, Williams, and Pacheco, so swapping Chuba Hubbard for a comparable back in Rhamondre Stevenson is a low-risk move. While Trey McBride is a great TE, this deal solves your biggest roster weakness by solidifying the most important position in fantasy."}
