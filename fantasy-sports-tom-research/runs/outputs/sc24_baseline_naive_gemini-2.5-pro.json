{"offer_from_A": ["Brock Purdy", "Joe Mixon", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson"], "rationale": "This trade provides a significant upgrade at Team A's starting QB position, swapping Brock Purdy (17.7) for Lamar Jackson (21.6), a +3.9 projected point increase. The players offered, Joe Mixon and Kyle Pitts Sr., are bench depth for Team A, which possesses elite starters at RB and TE (Saquon Barkley, De'Von Achane, Brock Bowers) who are unaffected. This move consolidates depth into a top-tier starter to maximize weekly points."}
