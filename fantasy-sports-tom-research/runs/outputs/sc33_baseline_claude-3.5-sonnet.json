{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Kyle Pitts Sr.", "Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Lamar Jackson"], "reasoning": "This trade aims to upgrade Team A's overall roster. We're offering Bijan Robinson, a top RB, but getting Saquon Barkley in return, who has a similar projection. The key improvements come at WR and QB. Amon-Ra St. Brown significantly boosts our WR corps, while Lamar Jackson provides a slight upgrade over Burrow at QB. We're including Kyle Pitts to sweeten the deal, as Team B might need TE depth."}
