{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "Keenan Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Cooper Kupp"], "reasoning": "This trade is a mutually beneficial deal addressing each team's primary needs by trading from positions of strength. Team A has a significant surplus at QB with Josh Allen and Joe Burrow, but could use another elite RB to pair with Saquon Barkley. Team B has incredible RB depth (Jeanty, Hall, Etienne Jr.) but lacks a true top-tier QB and high-end WRs beyond Cooper Kupp and Stefon Diggs. In this deal, Team A sends its QB2, Joe Burrow, for a massive upgrade to Team B's most important position. Team A also sends a reliable veteran WR, Keenan Allen, to bolster Team B's thin receiving corps. In return, Team A receives Alvin Kamara, a top-tier RB that immediately solidifies its starting lineup, and Cooper Kupp, who provides an upgrade at WR. Team B sacrifices RB depth it can afford to lose and an aging WR to acquire an elite franchise QB and a solid WR2, fundamentally improving their roster's ceiling."}
