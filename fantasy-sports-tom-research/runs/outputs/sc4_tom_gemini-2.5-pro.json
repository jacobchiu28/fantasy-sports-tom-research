{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs"], "ask_from_B": ["DJ Moore"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its critical need for a true WR1 in DJ Moore by trading from its area of exceptional depth at RB. Losing Josh Jacobs is manageable with Etienne, Walker, and Mixon still on the roster. Team B accepts because it creates an overwhelmingly dominant RB corps by adding Jacobs to Taylor and Henry, providing a massive weekly positional advantage. The trade is also appealing as they acquire the player with the significantly higher projection (Jacobs 15.5 vs. Moore 13.1), consolidating their strength for a clear championship path."}
