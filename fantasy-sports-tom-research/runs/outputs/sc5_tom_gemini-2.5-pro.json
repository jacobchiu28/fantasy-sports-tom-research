{"offer_from_A": ["Marvin Harrison Jr.", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Chris Godwin"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial 2-for-2 trade addressing key needs. Team A has strong WR depth but could use an elite RB to pair with Alvin Kamara. By offering a high-upside rookie WR and a solid RB2, Team A consolidates talent to acquire a top-tier RB in Jahmyr Gibbs. Team B has an embarrassment of riches at RB but lacks reliable WR depth behind CeeDee Lamb and Drake London. This trade provides them with a potential superstar in Marvin Harrison Jr. to be their WR2 and a dependable RB2 in Rhamondre Stevenson to backfill their RB room, improving two starting positions by trading from their deepest position."}
