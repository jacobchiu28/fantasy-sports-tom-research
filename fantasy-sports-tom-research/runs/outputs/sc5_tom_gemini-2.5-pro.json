{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams", "Chuba Hubbard"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor"], "reasoning": "Team A has an abundance of WR talent (Jefferson, Nacua, Adams, Flowers, McConkey) and can afford to move a top WR to upgrade its RB position. This trade gives Team A a true RB1 in Jonathan Taylor to pair with James Cook. For Team B, this trade addresses their most significant need: a top-tier WR. Davante Adams immediately becomes their WR1, providing a reliable, high-volume target alongside Nico Collins. They also receive a dependable RB2 in Chuba Hubbard, who adds valuable depth and a solid weekly floor to their RB corps. Team B trades from a position of relative strength (RB) to fix a major weakness (WR), making their overall starting lineup much stronger and more balanced. The value exchange is highly favorable for Team B, making it a compelling and likely acceptable offer."}
