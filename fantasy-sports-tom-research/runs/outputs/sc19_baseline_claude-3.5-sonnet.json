{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Diontae Johnson", "Evan Engram"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Calvin Ridley"], "reasoning": "We're offering depth for top-tier talent. Achane (17.1) is a significant upgrade over Etienne (10.0) at RB. Ridley (11.8) improves our WR corps, replacing the underperforming Johnson (5.4). We can afford to trade Engram due to our TE depth. This trade boosts our starting lineup while leveraging our roster depth."}
