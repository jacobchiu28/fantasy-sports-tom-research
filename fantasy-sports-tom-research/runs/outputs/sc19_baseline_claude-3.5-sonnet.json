{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "Jerry Jeudy", "Tyler Conklin"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Sam LaPorta"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and WR, allowing us to package Aaron Jones Sr. and Jerry Jeudy. We upgrade at RB with Gibbs, who has higher projected points. We also significantly improve at TE with LaPorta, addressing a weak spot. This trade balances our roster while acquiring higher-scoring players."}
