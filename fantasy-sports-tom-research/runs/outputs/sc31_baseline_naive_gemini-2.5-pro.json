{"offer_from_A": ["Patrick Mahomes II", "Tony Pollard"], "ask_from_B": ["Jayden Daniels", "James Conner"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's projected points by acquiring the player with the highest projection, Jayden Daniels (21.4), and upgrading at RB with James Conner (14.1). The combined 35.5 projection of the acquired players far exceeds the 30.3 projection of Patrick Mahomes II and Tony Pollard, resulting in a significant net increase to the team's weekly scoring potential."}
