{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jayden Reed"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a top RB, and Jayden Reed, a promising WR, to strengthen Team B's RB depth and provide a solid WR option. In return, Team A receives Justin Jefferson, an elite WR, to boost their WR core. Team B has strong WRs and can afford to trade Jefferson for RB depth, while Team A improves their WR position significantly."}
