{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Chris Godwin", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Tony Pollard", "DK Metcalf", "Darren Waller"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall depth. We upgrade at RB with Pollard, who has a higher projection than Taylor. Metcalf provides a strong WR option to replace Godwin. While Andrews has a higher projection than Waller, the difference is minimal, and this trade allows us to diversify our assets."}
