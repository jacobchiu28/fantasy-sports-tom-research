{"offer_from_A": ["Raheem Mostert", "Deebo Samuel Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Isiah Pacheco"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Raheem Mostert and Deebo Samuel Sr. to Team B in exchange for Isiah Pacheco. Team A is looking to strengthen their RB position with a more consistent performer like Pacheco, who has a higher projection than Mostert. Team B, on the other hand, receives a solid WR in Deebo Samuel Sr., which helps them bolster their WR depth, and Mostert provides additional RB depth. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A improves their RB lineup while Team B enhances their WR options, making it a fair and realistic proposal."}
