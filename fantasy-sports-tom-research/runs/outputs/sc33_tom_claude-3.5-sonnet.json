{"offer_from_A": ["Bijan Robinson", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Amon-Ra St. Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A offers a high-potential RB and TE for an established RB and WR. This trade benefits Team A by upgrading their WR corps with a top talent in St. Brown, while maintaining strong RB depth. For Team B, they get a promising young RB in Robinson who could match or exceed Barkley's production, and significantly upgrade their TE position with Pitts. The trade addresses Team A's WR weakness and Team B's TE needs, making it mutually beneficial and likely to be accepted."}
