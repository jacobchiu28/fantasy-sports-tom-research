{"offer_from_A": ["Austin Ekeler", "Tyler Lockett", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Joe Mixon"], "reasoning": "Team A offers depth at RB and TE for a WR upgrade. Ekeler (8.2) and Mixon (8.9) are similar, but A has RB depth. Lockett (6.0) is expendable for A. Kittle (13.2) is strong, but A has Bowers (14.4). Jefferson (18.4) significantly upgrades A's WR corps. B gains RB depth, a solid WR, and upgrades at TE. Fair value exchange addressing both teams' needs."}
