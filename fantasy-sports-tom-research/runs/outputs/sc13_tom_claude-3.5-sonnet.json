{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Calvin Ridley", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "A.J. Brown"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Barkley (19.3 proj) and WR with Brown (15.7 proj), addressing their need for elite players at these positions. Team B receives a solid RB in Cook (14.2 proj), a good WR in Ridley (11.8 proj), and an elite TE in Kittle (13.2 proj), improving their TE situation significantly. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and addresses needs for both teams, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
