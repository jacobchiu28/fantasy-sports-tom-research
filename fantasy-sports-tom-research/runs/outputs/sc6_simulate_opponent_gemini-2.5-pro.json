{"offer_from_A": ["Kyler Murray", "Jake Ferguson"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "Dalton Kincaid"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its significant QB depth to acquire an elite WR1. By offering Kyler Murray, Team B receives a massive and immediate upgrade at its weakest position. To balance the deal, Team A includes a quality starting TE in Jake Ferguson, receiving a high-upside young TE in Dalton Kincaid in return. This allows Team B to fill its primary QB need without creating a new roster hole, while Team A pairs the explosive Tyreek Hill with CeeDee Lamb to form a dominant WR corps."}
