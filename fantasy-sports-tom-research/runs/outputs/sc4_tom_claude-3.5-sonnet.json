{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "DJ Moore"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher projection than Jacobs. They also get a solid WR in Moore to replace Higgins. Team B gains a strong RB in Jacobs and upgrades at WR with Higgins, who has the highest projection among all WRs on both teams. This trade balances out both teams' rosters and provides mutual benefits, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
