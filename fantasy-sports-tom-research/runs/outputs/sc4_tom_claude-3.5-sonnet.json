{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Keenan Allen", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Cooper Kupp", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Kupp, gets a young RB with upside in Hall, and maintains TE strength with McBride. Team B receives an elite RB in Barkley, a consistent WR in Allen, and a top TE in Kittle. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it appealing for both sides."}
