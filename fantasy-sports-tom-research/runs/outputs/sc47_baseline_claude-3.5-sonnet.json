{"offer_from_A": ["Tyreek Hill", "Rhamondre Stevenson", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Ja'Marr Chase", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "This trade aims to upgrade Team A's RB and WR positions while maintaining strength at TE. Taylor is a significant upgrade over Stevenson, Chase offers higher upside than Hill, and Kittle is a slight downgrade from Andrews but still a top TE option. This trade balances immediate production with long-term potential."}
