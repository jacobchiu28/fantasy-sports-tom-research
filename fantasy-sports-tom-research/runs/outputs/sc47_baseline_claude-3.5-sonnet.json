{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor"], "reasoning": "Proposing J.K. Dobbins and Jaylen Waddle for Jonathan Taylor. This trade upgrades Team A's RB position significantly, as Taylor has a higher projection (16.2) than Dobbins (10.9). While losing Waddle (11.7) is a hit to WR depth, Team A still has strong WRs like Garrett Wilson and Jameson Williams. Team B gains a solid RB and a high-upside WR, potentially addressing their WR depth."}
