{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "CeeDee Lamb", "Bo Nix"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Cooper Kupp", "Justin Fields"], "reasoning": "This trade aims to upgrade Team A's RB1 position with McCaffrey, who has a higher projection than Henry. Kupp for Lamb is a slight downgrade but balances the trade. Swapping Nix for Fields adds a high-upside QB to compensate for the slight WR downgrade. Overall, this trade improves Team A's roster balance and potential."}
