{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Mike Evans", "Cole Kmet"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tee Higgins", "T.J. Hockenson"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength. We upgrade at RB with Jacobs (15.5 proj) over Montgomery (11.5 proj), maintain WR production by swapping Evans (14.6) for Higgins (14.4), and significantly improve at TE with Hockenson (10.7) over Kmet (3.9). Team B gets a solid RB and WR while freeing a roster spot."}
