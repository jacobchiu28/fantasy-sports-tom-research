{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "A.J. Brown", "Breece Hall"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Ja'Marr Chase"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by acquiring the top RB and WR from Team B. McCaffrey (18.6) is a significant upgrade over Hall (12.7), while Chase (19.5) outperforms Brown (15.7). Lawrence (17.9) is expendable due to Team A's QB depth. The trade balances positional needs and projected points, benefiting both teams."}
