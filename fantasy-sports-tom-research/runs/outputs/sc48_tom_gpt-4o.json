{"offer_from_A": ["Chuba Hubbard", "Marquise Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Chuba Hubbard, a high-projection RB, and Marquise Brown, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Tee Higgins. Team B has a surplus of WRs and could use additional depth at RB, especially with Hubbard's high projection. Team A, on the other hand, strengthens its WR position with Higgins, who has a higher projection than Brown. This trade balances both teams' rosters by addressing Team B's need for RB depth and Team A's desire for a stronger WR."}
