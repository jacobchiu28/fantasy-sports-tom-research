{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Christian Kirk"], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Cooper Kupp"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry (RB, 16.2 proj) and Christian Kirk (WR, 7.8 proj) for Kenneth Walker III (RB, 13.7 proj) and Cooper Kupp (WR, 11.1 proj). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Kupp while maintaining strong RB depth. Team B gets a slight upgrade at RB with Henry and adds depth at WR. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and addresses needs for both teams. Team B is likely to accept as they improve their RB1 position and maintain WR strength."}
