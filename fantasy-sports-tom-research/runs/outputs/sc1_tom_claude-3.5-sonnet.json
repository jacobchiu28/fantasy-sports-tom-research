{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Terry McLaurin", "Josh Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Henry, a consistent top performer, and gets an elite WR in Lamb. Team B receives a promising young RB in Achane, a solid WR1 in McLaurin, and a top-tier QB in Allen. This addresses Team B's need for QB improvement and WR depth, while maintaining RB strength. Team A improves its starting lineup significantly. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it attractive for both sides."}
