{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaylen Warren and Terry McLaurin to Team B in exchange for Derrick Henry. Team A has a surplus of RBs and needs a strong RB to pair with Jonathan Taylor and Jahmyr Gibbs. Derrick Henry provides a high-projection RB option. Team B receives a solid WR in McLaurin to strengthen their WR lineup, which lacks depth beyond Tyreek Hill and Malik Nabers, and a promising RB in Warren to maintain RB depth. This trade addresses Team B's need for a reliable WR and maintains their RB depth, making it a fair and mutually beneficial exchange."}
