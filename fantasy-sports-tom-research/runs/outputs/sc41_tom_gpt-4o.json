{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Jakobi Meyers"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane, a high-performing RB, and Jakobi Meyers, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for CeeDee Lamb, an elite WR. Team B has depth at WR with Tyreek Hill and Justin Jefferson, making Lamb expendable. Team B also needs RB depth, which Achane provides, and Meyers can fill the WR gap. Team A strengthens its WR core with Lamb, addressing a need for a top-tier WR."}
