{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Nico Collins"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Rome Odunze"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane and Nico Collins to Team B in exchange for Alvin Kamara and Rome Odunze. Team A strengthens its RB position with Kamara, who has a solid projection, and adds depth to WR with Odunze. Team B receives Achane, who has a high projection and potential upside, and Collins, who is a strong WR option, addressing their need for a higher projected RB and WR depth. This trade balances both teams' rosters and provides mutual benefits, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
