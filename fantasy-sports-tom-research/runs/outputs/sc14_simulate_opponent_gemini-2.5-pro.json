{"offer_from_A": ["Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["Ladd McConkey"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite TE depth to acquire a high-upside WR, its biggest roster need. Team B fixes its weakest position, TE, by trading from its WR strength. The trade features players with identical projections, making it a perfectly balanced win-win scenario that immediately improves both starting lineups."}
