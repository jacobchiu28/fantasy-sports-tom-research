{"offer_from_A": ["Breece Hall", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Brian Thomas Jr.", "Jaylen Warren"], "rationale": "This trade helps both teams. Team A addresses its need for a top WR by trading from its TE depth (while still retaining Mark Andrews). Team B gets an elite, proven TE in Kittle to pair with Bowers, creating a massive positional advantage, and also upgrades at RB with the high-upside Breece Hall."}
