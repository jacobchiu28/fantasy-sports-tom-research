{"offer_from_A": ["Chuba Hubbard", "Marquise Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its WR position with a high-projection player. Offering Chuba Hubbard, who has a higher projection than some of Team B's RBs, and Marquise Brown, a solid WR, for Tee Higgins, who has a higher projection than Brown, provides Team B with depth at RB and a comparable WR, while Team A gains a stronger WR option."}
