{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Cooper Kupp"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey"], "reasoning": "Proposing to trade Derrick Henry and Cooper Kupp for Christian McCaffrey. This trade aims to upgrade Team A's RB position significantly. McCaffrey's projected 18.6 points outperform Henry's 16.2, and Team A can afford to part with Kupp due to strong WR depth with Chase, Adams, and Nabers. This trade consolidates value into a single elite RB, potentially improving Team A's overall scoring potential."}
