{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Malik Nabers", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Brian Thomas Jr.", "Calvin Ridley", "Isiah Pacheco"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's overall depth and potential. We're trading Achane (high upside but uncertain role) for Pacheco (established starter), upgrading at WR with Thomas Jr. and Ridley, while only slightly downgrading at TE. This balances our roster and increases our weekly scoring potential."}
