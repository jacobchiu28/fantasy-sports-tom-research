{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Nico Collins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry and Jerry Jeudy to Team B in exchange for Jonathan Taylor and Nico Collins. Team A aims to strengthen its RB position with a younger, high-upside player in Taylor while maintaining WR strength with Collins. Team B receives a proven RB in Henry, who can immediately contribute, and Jeudy, who adds depth to their WR corps. This trade balances both teams' needs, with Team A getting a younger RB and Team B gaining immediate impact players."}
