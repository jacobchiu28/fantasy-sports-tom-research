{"offer_from_A": ["Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride"], "rationale": "Team A addresses its critical need for a top-tier TE. Team B has an unprecedented surplus at TE (Kelce, Kittle, McBride) and this trade converts a valuable bench asset into an elite starting WR in Tee Higgins to pair with Puka Nacua, significantly strengthening their receiver corps. This is a mutually beneficial trade based on clear positional needs and surpluses."}
