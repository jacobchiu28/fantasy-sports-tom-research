{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "DK Metcalf"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "David Montgomery"], "reasoning": "Team A trades away Saquon Barkley (19.3) and DK Metcalf (12.7) for Justin Jefferson (18.4) and David Montgomery (11.5). This trade improves Team A's WR corps significantly with Jefferson, while maintaining RB depth with Montgomery. The slight decrease in RB projection is offset by the upgrade at WR, where Team A was weaker."}
