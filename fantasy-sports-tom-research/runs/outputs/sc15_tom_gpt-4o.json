{"offer_from_A": ["Chuba Hubbard", "Khalil Shakir"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Chuba Hubbard, a high-projection RB, and Khalil Shakir, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Breece Hall. Team A has a surplus of RBs and can afford to trade Hubbard, while Team B can benefit from Hubbard's immediate RB production and Shakir's WR depth, addressing their weaker WR position. Breece Hall strengthens Team A's RB lineup, providing a consistent performer. This trade is mutually beneficial as it balances both teams' positional needs and maintains competitive projections."}
