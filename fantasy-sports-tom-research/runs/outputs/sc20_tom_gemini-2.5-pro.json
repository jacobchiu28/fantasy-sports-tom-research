{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts"], "reasoning": "Team A has elite depth at TE (Bowers and Kittle) and WR, allowing them to consolidate two strong starters into a top-tier QB, creating a significant weekly advantage. Team B drastically improves its two weakest positions, acquiring a true WR1 in Terry McLaurin and a top-3 TE in George Kittle. Team B can absorb the QB downgrade by starting the capable Baker Mayfield, making this a mutually beneficial trade that addresses their most critical needs."}
