{"offer_from_A": ["George Kittle", "Tetairoa McMillan"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry", "David Njoku"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial, addressing each team's primary weakness. Team A has a significant need for a top-tier running back, which Derrick Henry (16.2 proj) immediately provides, transforming their weak RB corps into a strength. While downgrading from George Kittle (13.2) to David Njoku (10.6) at tight end, Team A still retains a solid TE1 and solves their most critical roster hole. Team B benefits immensely by trading from their exceptional RB depth (still retaining Kyren Williams, Bucky Irving, and Chase Brown) to fix their two biggest needs. They acquire an elite, top-3 TE in George Kittle, a major upgrade over Njoku, and land a desperately needed WR2 in Tetairoa McMillan (12.4) to pair with Mike Evans. This move significantly strengthens Team B's starting lineup where they need it most, making them a more balanced and formidable contender."}
