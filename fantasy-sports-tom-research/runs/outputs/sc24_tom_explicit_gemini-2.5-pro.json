{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Brock Purdy"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "Alvin Kamara"], "rationale": "Your QB room is the best in the league, but you're lacking a true workhorse RB1. This deal lets you leverage that incredible QB depth to acquire Saquon Barkley to anchor your team. You still retain an elite QB group with Burrow, Kyler, and Stroud, while adding a solid QB1 in Purdy. The upgrade from Kamara to Barkley gives you a significant weekly advantage at RB. For us, we get the elite QB we need, making this a win-win that addresses both of our primary roster needs."}
