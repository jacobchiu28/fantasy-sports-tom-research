{"offer_from_A": ["Nico Collins", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Garrett Wilson"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic strengths-for-strengths swap that addresses each team's primary need. Team A leverages its incredible WR depth to acquire an elite, top-tier TE in Trey McBride, significantly upgrading from David Njoku and solidifying a key starting position. In return, Team B addresses its main weakness, a lack of elite WR depth, by adding Nico Collins to form a dominant trio with Amon-Ra and Puka Nacua. While downgrading from McBride, they receive a very solid starting TE in David Njoku, making the drop-off manageable and greatly improving their overall roster balance and weekly scoring potential. The inclusion of Garrett Wilson balances the value and makes the deal mutually beneficial."}
