{"offer_from_A": ["Dak Prescott", "Jaylen Waddle"], "ask_from_B": ["Jalen Hurts", "James Cook"], "rationale": "This trade maximizes Team A's projected points by consolidating depth for elite talent. We leverage our surplus of QBs and WRs by trading Dak Prescott and Jaylen Waddle to acquire a top-tier QB in Jalen Hurts and a high-upside RB1 in James Cook. This move significantly raises our weekly scoring ceiling by upgrading two key starting positions while dealing from a position of strength."}
