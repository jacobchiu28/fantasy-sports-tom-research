{"offer_from_A": ["Kyler Murray", "Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley"], "reasoning": "Team A has a critical need for an elite RB and a surplus of high-end QBs. This trade sends a top QB in Kyler Murray to upgrade Team B's weakest position and a WR1 in Davante Adams. In return, Team A acquires a cornerstone RB in Saquon Barkley, balancing its roster by trading from depth to fill a major starting lineup hole. Team B can easily afford to move an RB from their stacked backfield to significantly improve at QB."}
