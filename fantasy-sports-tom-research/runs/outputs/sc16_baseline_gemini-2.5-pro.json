{"offer_from_A": ["T.J. Hockenson", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Garrett Wilson", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's primary weakness. My team needs a true WR1, and your team needs an elite TE. I get Garrett Wilson to lead my receiving corps, which is a major upgrade. In return, you get T.J. Hockenson, a top-tier TE who represents a significant improvement over Dallas Goedert. You also receive George Pickens, a solid WR with high upside, to bolster your already stacked WR depth. You can afford to part with Wilson given your strength at the position (Lamb, Evans, Moore), while significantly improving your starting TE spot."}
