{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Allen", "Josh Downs"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite RB depth to acquire the best QB in the league, solving a major need. The WR swap provides Team B with an upgrade to incentivize the deal. Team B addresses its critical RB weakness with a true workhorse in Barkley and gets a better WR2 in Pickens, creating a powerful RB/WR starting lineup by trading from its QB strength."}
