{"offer_from_A": ["David Montgomery", "Calvin Ridley"], "ask_from_B": ["Ashton Jeanty", "Zay Flowers"], "reasoning": "Team A offers David Montgomery and Calvin Ridley to strengthen Team B's RB and WR depth with consistent performers. In return, Team A receives Ashton Jeanty, a high-upside RB, and Zay Flowers, a promising WR, to boost their overall scoring potential. Team B benefits by gaining a reliable RB in Montgomery and a solid WR in Ridley, addressing their need for consistent production, while Team A takes a calculated risk on Jeanty's potential and Flowers' emerging talent."}
