{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels", "Jonathan Taylor"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A has a major surplus at QB and RB but is critically weak at WR. This trade leverages that strength by offering a massive QB upgrade in Jayden Daniels and a top-tier RB in Jonathan Taylor to Team B. In return, Team A acquires the elite WR1 it desperately needs in Tyreek Hill, while also getting a solid starting RB in James Conner to maintain RB depth. This is a win-win: Team B significantly boosts its QB and RB positions, while Team A balances its roster and acquires a game-changing receiver."}
