{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB position with a high-projection player. Offering Baker Mayfield, who is a strong QB but not essential with Jalen Hurts on the roster, and Tyler Lockett, a solid WR, to acquire James Conner from Team B. This trade benefits Team A by adding a reliable RB with a high projection, while Team B gains depth at QB and WR."}
