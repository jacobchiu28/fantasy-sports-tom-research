{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts", "George Kittle", "Javonte Williams"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "Kyren Williams", "Darren Waller"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by upgrading at QB and RB while maintaining a strong TE. Lamar Jackson offers higher upside than Hurts, Kyren Williams is a significant upgrade over Javonte Williams, and while Kittle is better than Waller, the difference is less impactful than the improvements at QB and RB."}
