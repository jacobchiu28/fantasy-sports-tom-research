{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Keenan Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Jaylen Waddle"], "rationale": "We both have a clear surplus at key positions; my team is deep at QB while your team rosters two elite TEs. This trade allows us to swap those surplus assets to fill our primary needs. My team gets an elite TE1 in McBride and a high-upside WR2 in Waddle. Your team acquires a top-tier QB in Herbert, a perfect complement or high-end backup for Josh Allen, and a reliable veteran WR in Allen to bolster your corps. The projected points are nearly identical, making this a balanced, mutually beneficial deal that immediately improves both our starting lineups."}
