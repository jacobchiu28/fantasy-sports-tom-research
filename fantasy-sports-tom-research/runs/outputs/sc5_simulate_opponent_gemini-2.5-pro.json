{"offer_from_A": ["Sam LaPorta", "Jerome Ford"], "ask_from_B": ["Josh Jacobs"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite TE depth to acquire a top-tier RB in Josh Jacobs, consolidating talent into a starting RB slot. Team B solves its most significant roster weakness by acquiring Sam LaPorta, a massive upgrade at TE, and adds RB depth with Jerome Ford while only giving up their second-best running back."}
