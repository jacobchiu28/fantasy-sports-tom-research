{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Jerry Jeudy"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams", "James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade Henry. Upgrading at WR with Adams significantly improves the starting lineup. Conner provides a solid RB replacement with similar projected points to Henry. Jeudy is included to balance the trade, as his projection is lower than Adams'."}
