{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "DK Metcalf", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Cooper Kupp", "Joe Burrow"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A by upgrading at QB with Burrow, who has the highest projection. We get a slight downgrade at RB from Jacobs to Hall, but Hall has more upside. Kupp for Metcalf is a lateral move with potential for Kupp to outperform. We can afford to trade Njoku as we have strong TE depth."}
