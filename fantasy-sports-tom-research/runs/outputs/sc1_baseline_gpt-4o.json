{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Jaylen Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering two high-potential RBs, De'Von Achane and Jaylen Warren, to acquire Derrick Henry from Team B. Achane and Warren have strong projections and can provide depth to Team B's RB lineup, which lacks high-projection players beyond Henry. In return, Team A receives a consistent and proven RB1 in Henry, which strengthens their starting lineup and balances their roster with a reliable performer."}
