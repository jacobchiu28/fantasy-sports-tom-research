{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "Drake London"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaylen Warren and Drake London to Team B in exchange for James Conner. Team A strengthens their RB position with a high-projection player, addressing their need for a more reliable RB option. Team B receives a promising RB in Warren and a high-projection WR in London, enhancing their WR depth and compensating for the loss of Conner. This trade is mutually beneficial as Team B has strong RB depth and can afford to trade Conner while improving their WR lineup."}
