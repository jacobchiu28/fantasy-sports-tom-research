{"offer_from_A": ["Jordan Love", "Keenan Allen"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Isiah Pacheco"], "rationale": "Your QB situation is your weakness, while it's my deepest position. This trade gives you a top-10 QB in Jordan Love, a significant upgrade over your current options. You also receive a reliable veteran WR in Keenan Allen. In return, I get an elite young WR in Nico Collins to pair with Ja'Marr Chase and a solid starting RB in Isiah Pacheco, allowing me to consolidate my roster depth into top-tier starters. It's a win-win that directly addresses both our teams' needs."}
