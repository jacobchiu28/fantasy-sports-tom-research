{"offer_from_A": ["Kenneth Walker III"], "ask_from_B": ["Davante Adams"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its significant RB depth (Kamara, Hall, Walker) to acquire an elite WR1. Team B addresses its biggest positional need by landing a top-tier RB in Kenneth Walker III, giving them a formidable 1-2 punch with James Conner. This is a mutually beneficial deal where each team trades from a surplus to fill a major roster hole."}
