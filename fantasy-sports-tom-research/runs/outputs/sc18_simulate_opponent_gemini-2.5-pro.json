{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Marquise Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Javonte Williams"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing our biggest needs. Your team is stacked at WR but needs a true RB1, while my roster has a surplus of RBs and needs an elite WR. This deal lands you a top-10 RB in Josh Jacobs, a massive upgrade, while I get the elite WR1 I need in St. Brown. The swap of Brown for Williams helps balance out the projected values and gives you a usable receiver back. It's a classic strength-for-strength deal that improves both our starting rosters."}
