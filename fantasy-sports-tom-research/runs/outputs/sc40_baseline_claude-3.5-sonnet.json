{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "George Pickens", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Drake London", "Cole Kmet"], "reasoning": "This trade improves Team A's RB and WR positions while maintaining TE strength. Walker III has higher projected points than Jones Sr., London offers similar production to Pickens with potentially higher upside, and Kmet, while lower projected, allows us to keep a solid TE while upgrading other positions."}
