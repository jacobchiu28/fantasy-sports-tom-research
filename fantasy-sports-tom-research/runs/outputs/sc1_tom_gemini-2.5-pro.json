{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Marquise Brown"], "reasoning": "Team A has an abundance of starting-caliber QBs and leverages a surplus asset in Justin Herbert to address Team B's need for a top-tier QB. The inclusion of Terry McLaurin provides Team B a desperately needed reliable WR2 behind CeeDee Lamb. In return, Team A acquires an elite RB in Breece Hall to create a league-winning backfield and receives Marquise Brown to maintain WR depth, effectively consolidating talent for a championship run while helping Team B balance its top-heavy roster."}
