{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Justin Herbert"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Kenneth Walker III"], "reasoning": "Team A has a major surplus at QB and RB but desperately needs an elite WR1. This trade uses that surplus to acquire the league-winning talent of CeeDee Lamb. Team A can afford to move Justin Herbert because of its depth with Bo Nix, Drake Maye, and Justin Fields. It also gets a strong RB2 back in Kenneth Walker III to pair with Achane and Kamara. For Team B, this trade is a huge win. Their primary weakness is RB, and they upgrade significantly from Walker to the workhorse Derrick Henry. Furthermore, they acquire an elite QB in Justin Herbert to pair with Josh Allen, giving them unparalleled strength and security at the most important position. While losing Lamb hurts, the massive upgrades at two other key positions make their overall roster far more formidable and balanced."}
