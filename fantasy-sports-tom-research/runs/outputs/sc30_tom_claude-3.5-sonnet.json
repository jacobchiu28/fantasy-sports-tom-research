{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Tony Pollard", "Chris Olave"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth at RB for a solid RB2 and upgrades at WR. Team B gets a top-tier RB1 and a promising young WR. This trade balances both teams' rosters, addressing Team B's need for a star RB while giving Team A a more balanced RB corps and improved WR depth. Team B likely accepts due to Barkley's high ceiling and Pickens' potential."}
