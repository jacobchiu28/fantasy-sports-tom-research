{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Joe Mixon"], "reasoning": "Team A has depth at RB and can afford to trade Barkley. Upgrading at WR with Jefferson significantly improves the starting lineup. Mixon provides RB depth to replace Barkley. Adams is included to balance the trade value. This trade improves Team A's overall roster strength and starting lineup potential."}
