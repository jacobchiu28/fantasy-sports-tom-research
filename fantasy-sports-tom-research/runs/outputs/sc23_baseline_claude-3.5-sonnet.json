{"offer_from_A": ["Saquon Barkley", "Courtland Sutton"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Deebo Samuel Sr."], "reasoning": "This trade aims to diversify Team A's roster while maintaining overall value. Barkley and Taylor are both high-scoring RBs, but Taylor offers slightly more consistency. Swapping Sutton for Samuel gives Team A a versatile WR who can also contribute in the run game. This trade balances Team A's positional strength and adds a dynamic playmaker in Samuel."}
