{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "Isiah Pacheco"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a top-tier WR and a solid starting RB, significantly improving two positions. Team B addresses its most pressing need with a massive upgrade at QB, trading from its deep pool of WR and RB talent to do so. This is a classic win-win trade based on roster construction."}
