{"offer_from_A": ["Davante Adams", "Brock Bowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Tony Pollard"], "reasoning": "This trade is a blockbuster that creates a more balanced roster for Team B while allowing Team A to acquire an elite cornerstone WR. Team B addresses its most significant weakness by acquiring Brock Bowers, a generational TE prospect who immediately solves their TE problem. While downgrading from Jefferson to Adams, they still retain an elite WR corps with Adams, Mike Evans, and Chris Olave. Team A is willing to part with the elite rookie TE Bowers because they still have Travis Kelce, and they upgrade significantly at WR with Justin Jefferson. Adding Tony Pollard provides even more depth to an already strong RB room. The trade is balanced from a value perspective and directly addresses positional needs, making it mutually beneficial and likely to be accepted by Team B."}
