{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Allen", "George Pickens"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "This is a blockbuster trade addressing both teams' primary needs. Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a top-tier RB in Bijan Robinson and a WR upgrade in Tee Higgins, solving its weakest position. Team B solves its desperate need for a stud QB with Josh Allen, a significant upgrade over their current options. While losing Bijan hurts, they retain a solid RB in James Conner, and the downgrade from Higgins to Pickens is a small price for a league-winning QB, making the deal highly attractive and fair for both sides."}
