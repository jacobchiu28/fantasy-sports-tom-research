{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Courtland Sutton"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry (RB) and Courtland Sutton (WR) for Justin Jefferson (WR). This trade benefits both teams: Team B gains a strong RB1 in Henry, addressing their weak RB corps, and a solid WR2 in Sutton. Team A upgrades at WR with Jefferson, pairing him with Chase and St. Brown for an elite WR trio. Team A can afford to trade Henry due to depth at RB (Robinson, Barkley, Gibbs). Team B likely accepts as they significantly improve at RB while maintaining strong WR depth."}
