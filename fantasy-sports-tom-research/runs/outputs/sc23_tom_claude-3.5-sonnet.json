{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Mixon", "Courtland Sutton", "Mark Andrews"], "ask_from_B": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Deebo Samuel Sr."], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Taylor, who has higher projection than Mixon. They also get a solid WR in Samuel to bolster their receiving corps. Team B receives a starting RB in Mixon, an upgrade at WR with Sutton, and a significant TE upgrade with Andrews. This addresses Team B's need for WR depth and TE improvement, while maintaining RB strength. The trade is balanced in terms of overall projected points, making it appealing for both sides."}
