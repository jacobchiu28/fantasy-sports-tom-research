{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook"], "ask_from_B": ["Chris Olave", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic 'needs-based' deal that benefits both teams. Team A has an abundance of high-end running backs but is weak at TE and could use more WR depth. This move consolidates some of that RB depth into a significant upgrade at TE with Dallas Goedert and a solid WR3 in Chris Olave, without sacrificing a top-tier RB. Team B's most glaring weakness is at running back, where James Cook would immediately become their top option. They can afford to part with Olave, as they are stacked at WR with Lamb and St. Brown, and have a capable replacement for Goedert in Jake Ferguson. Team B solves their biggest roster hole by trading from positions of strength, making their team more balanced."}
