{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Trey McBride"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Mark Andrews"], "reasoning": "This trade is a win-win addressing each team's primary need. Team A desperately needs a top-tier RB and acquires Saquon Barkley, transforming their biggest weakness into a strength. While downgrading at TE from McBride to Andrews, they still retain a top-tier TE and have solid QB depth in Justin Herbert. Team B significantly upgrades their weakest starting position, swapping Mark Andrews for the elite Trey McBride, giving them a dominant player at every offensive position. They also acquire Baker Mayfield, an elite QB asset for depth or future trades, while only sacrificing RB depth, a position where they remain strong with Isiah Pacheco."}
