{"offer_from_A": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane"], "rationale": "This is a classic strength-for-strength trade that addresses each team's primary weakness. My team has an abundance of elite WR talent but lacks a top-tier RB, while your team is loaded with high-end RBs but lacks a true #1 WR. This swap provides you with a consistent, high-volume WR1 in St. Brown, while giving my team the explosive RB1 it needs in Achane. The projected values are nearly identical, making this a perfectly balanced and mutually beneficial deal."}
