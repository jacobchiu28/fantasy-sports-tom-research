{"offer_from_A": ["James Cook", "Dallas Goedert"], "ask_from_B": ["Drake London"], "rationale": "Team A consolidates talent by trading from its deep RB and TE positions to acquire an elite young WR. Team B addresses its two biggest weaknesses by acquiring a legitimate RB1 in Cook and a top-10 TE in Goedert, massively improving their starting lineup's floor by trading from their WR depth."}
