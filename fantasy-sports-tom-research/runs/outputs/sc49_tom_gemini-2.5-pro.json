{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Zay Flowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins", "Trey McBride"], "reasoning": "This is a balanced, mutually beneficial trade that allows both teams to upgrade areas of need by dealing from positions of significant depth. Team A is stacked at RB but weak at WR and TE. This move provides a true WR1 in Tee Higgins and an elite TE in Trey McBride, massively improving Team A's starting lineup. Team B is desperate for RB depth beyond their top two, and Josh Jacobs provides a reliable, high-volume starter. Team B can easily afford to trade Trey McBride, as they still roster George Kittle and Sam LaPorta, and Zay Flowers is a strong, high-upside replacement for Tee Higgins. Both teams address their biggest roster holes, making this a classic win-win."}
