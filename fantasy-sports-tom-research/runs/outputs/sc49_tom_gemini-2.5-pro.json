{"offer_from_A": ["Zay Flowers", "Justin Herbert"], "ask_from_B": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Justin Fields"], "reasoning": "This trade is a mutually beneficial exchange of depth for need. Team A has an elite surplus of WRs and QBs but is desperate for a top RB. By offering a high-end WR2 in Zay Flowers and a top-tier QB in Justin Herbert, Team A acquires a legitimate RB1 in Travis Etienne Jr. and a high-upside QB in Justin Fields, still leaving them with strong QB options. Team B's biggest weakness is WR, and Flowers immediately becomes a top option for them. They also get a significant QB upgrade in Herbert over Fields, providing a higher floor. Since Team B has incredible RB depth (Ashton Jeanty, Tony Pollard, D'Andre Swift), they can easily afford to trade Etienne to drastically improve their starting lineup at two key positions of need."}
