{"offer_from_A": ["Stefon Diggs", "Chuba Hubbard"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner", "Jaxon Smith-Njigba"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its primary need for a workhorse RB in James Conner by leveraging its WR depth. This move sells high on Chuba Hubbard's projection and trades Stefon Diggs, who faces uncertainty on a new team, for a high-upside young receiver in Jaxon Smith-Njigba, improving Team A's RB corps and long-term WR outlook."}
