{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "David Njoku"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Dallas Goedert"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of quality QBs and can consolidate that depth to acquire an elite, high-upside RB in Gibbs, which is its biggest positional need. Team B leverages its incredible RB depth to get a significant upgrade at TE with Njoku and an elite QB insurance policy in Lawrence, shoring up its primary roster weakness behind Jalen Hurts."}
