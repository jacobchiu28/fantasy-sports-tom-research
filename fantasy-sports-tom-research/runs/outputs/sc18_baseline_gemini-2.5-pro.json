{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Adam Thielen"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Hunter Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of elite QBs with Josh Allen, C.J. Stroud, and Trevor Lawrence, while Team B is in desperate need of a reliable starter. This trade leverages Team A's QB depth to address its two weakest positions: RB2 and TE. By acquiring Bijan Robinson, Team A creates an elite RB duo with Derrick Henry. Adding Hunter Henry provides a significant upgrade at tight end. For Team B, this deal provides a franchise QB in Trevor Lawrence and a reliable veteran WR in Adam Thielen. Team B can afford to trade Bijan Robinson due to their extraordinary RB depth (Christian McCaffrey, Kyren Williams) and solves their most critical roster issue."}
