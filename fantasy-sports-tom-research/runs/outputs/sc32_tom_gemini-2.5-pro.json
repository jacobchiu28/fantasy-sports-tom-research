{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels", "Adam Thielen"], "ask_from_B": ["Zay Flowers", "Justin Herbert"], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A leverages its significant QB depth to acquire a much-needed top-tier WR in Zay Flowers, significantly improving its starting lineup's balance. Team A still retains a strong QB in Justin Herbert. Team B, already rostering the elite Patrick Mahomes II, accepts this trade to acquire Jayden Daniels, a QB with massive upside, consolidating their QB room. They sacrifice their top WR but receive a reliable veteran in Adam Thielen, maintaining solid WR depth while gambling on the higher ceiling of Daniels."}
