{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Chris Godwin", "Tyler Warren"], "ask_from_B": ["Tony Pollard", "DK Metcalf"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with DK Metcalf (12.7 proj) over Chris Godwin (4.8 proj), while getting a solid RB in Tony Pollard (10.4 proj) to replace Jonathan Taylor (16.2 proj). Team B receives a potential RB1 in Taylor, upgrades at TE with Warren (8.2 proj) over their current options, and gets a WR with upside in Godwin. Team B likely accepts as they improve at RB and TE while maintaining WR depth. The trade addresses Team A's need for WR improvement and Team B's need for a top RB and TE upgrade."}
