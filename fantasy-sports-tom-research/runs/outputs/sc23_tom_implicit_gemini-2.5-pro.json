{"offer_from_A": ["DJ Moore", "D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Breece Hall", "Rome Odunze"], "rationale": "Team A trades from its WR depth and RB surplus to acquire an elite young RB in Breece Hall and a high-upside rookie WR in Rome Odunze. Team B lands a much-needed proven WR1 in DJ Moore to anchor its young receiving corps and gets a solid starting RB in D'Andre Swift to immediately backfill its RB room."}
