{"offer_from_A": ["Jaylen Warren", "Diontae Johnson"], "ask_from_B": ["Chuba Hubbard"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jaylen Warren and Diontae Johnson to Team B in exchange for Chuba Hubbard. Team A has a surplus of RBs and needs a stronger RB to complement Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. Chuba Hubbard, with a higher projection than Warren, strengthens Team A's RB lineup. Team B, on the other hand, receives a promising RB in Warren and a WR in Johnson, addressing their need for depth at WR, given their weaker WR options beyond the top few. This trade is mutually beneficial as it strengthens Team A's RB core while providing Team B with depth and potential upside at both RB and WR positions."}
