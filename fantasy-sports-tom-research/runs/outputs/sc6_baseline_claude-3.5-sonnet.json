{"offer_from_A": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Drake London"], "ask_from_B": ["Lamar Jackson", "Calvin Ridley", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "Team A is deep at RB but needs QB and WR upgrades. McCaffrey is a top RB, but Jackson's dual-threat ability offers higher upside. Ridley and Jones Sr. provide solid depth, offsetting the loss of London. This trade balances Team A's roster while acquiring a elite QB."}
