{"offer_from_A": ["Amon-Ra St. Brown"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing our teams' primary needs. Team A gets a true RB1 by trading from its incredible WR depth. Team B acquires a consensus top-5 WR to fix its weakest position group, while still having an elite RB in De'Von Achane. The projections are nearly identical, making it a fair, win-win deal that significantly improves both starting lineups."}
