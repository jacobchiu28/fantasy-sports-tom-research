{"offer_from_A": ["De'Von Achane", "Khalil Shakir"], "ask_from_B": ["Derrick Henry"], "reasoning": "Team A offers De'Von Achane, a high-projection RB, and Khalil Shakir, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Derrick Henry. Team A strengthens its RB position with a proven performer in Henry, while Team B receives a promising RB in Achane to bolster their weaker RB lineup and a WR in Shakir to add depth to their WR corps. This trade addresses Team B's need for a high-upside RB and additional WR depth, making it a fair and mutually beneficial exchange."}
