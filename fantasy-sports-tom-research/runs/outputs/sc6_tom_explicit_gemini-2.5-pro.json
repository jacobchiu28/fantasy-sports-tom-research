{"offer_from_A": ["Jayden Daniels"], "ask_from_B": ["Nico Collins", "Najee Harris"], "rationale": "Your team gets a massive upgrade at your weakest position (QB) with a potential top-5 fantasy asset in Jayden Daniels. My team has the QB depth to spare. In return, you send Nico Collins from your area of greatest strength (WR), where you remain stacked with Hill, Adams, and Pittman Jr. This trade fixes your QB problem and makes both our teams stronger."}
