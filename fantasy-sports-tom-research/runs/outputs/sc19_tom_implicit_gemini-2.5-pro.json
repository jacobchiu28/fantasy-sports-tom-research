{"offer_from_A": ["Mike Evans"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams"], "rationale": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing each team's primary need by swapping players from positions of strength. Team A acquires a top-tier RB1 in Kyren Williams to fix its biggest roster deficiency. Team B receives a premier WR1 in Mike Evans to significantly upgrade its receiving corps. The players' projections are nearly identical, making it a perfectly balanced trade."}
