{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "George Kittle"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Sam LaPorta"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its significant depth at QB and TE to acquire a true top-tier RB in Bijan Robinson. Team B sells from its incredible RB depth to get a massive upgrade at QB with Trevor Lawrence and a clear TE1 upgrade with George Kittle, addressing their two weakest positions."}
