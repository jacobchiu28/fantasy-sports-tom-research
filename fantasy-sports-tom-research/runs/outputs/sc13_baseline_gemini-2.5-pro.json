{"offer_from_A": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Brock Bowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "Alvin Kamara"], "reasoning": "This trade is a classic win-win, addressing each team's primary need. Team B receives a massive upgrade at its weakest position, RB, by acquiring the young, elite Jahmyr Gibbs, and also gets the top rookie TE, Brock Bowers, from our depth. In return, Team A acquires the cornerstone WR1 it needs in Justin Jefferson while getting a reliable RB1 in Alvin Kamara to maintain a strong running back corps. Both teams significantly improve their starting lineups."}
