{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Courtland Sutton"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Drake London"], "reasoning": "This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Barkley (19.3 proj) over Taylor (16.2 proj), while also improving at WR with London (15.2 proj) over Sutton (12.9 proj). Team B gets a solid RB1 in Taylor and improves WR depth with Sutton. B might accept as they maintain RB strength while addressing WR needs. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional value."}
