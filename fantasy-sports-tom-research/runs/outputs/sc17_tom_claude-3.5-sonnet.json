{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Garrett Wilson"], "ask_from_B": ["Justin Jefferson", "James Cook"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Josh Jacobs (RB, 15.5) and Garrett Wilson (WR, 12.6) for Justin Jefferson (WR, 18.4) and James Cook (RB, 14.2). This trade benefits both teams. Team A upgrades at WR with Jefferson, the top WR, while maintaining RB depth. Team B improves RB significantly with Jacobs, addressing their weak RB corps, and gets a solid WR replacement in Wilson. The trade is balanced in projected points and positional needs, making it attractive for both sides."}
