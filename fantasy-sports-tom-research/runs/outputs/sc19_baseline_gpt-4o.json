{"offer_from_A": ["Travis Etienne Jr.", "Diontae Johnson"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane"], "reasoning": "Team A is offering Travis Etienne Jr., a solid RB, and Diontae Johnson, a WR with potential upside, to acquire De'Von Achane from Team B. Achane has a higher projection and can significantly boost Team A's RB lineup. This trade balances Team A's roster by consolidating talent into a higher-performing RB, while Team B gains depth with a reliable RB and a WR to strengthen their roster."}
