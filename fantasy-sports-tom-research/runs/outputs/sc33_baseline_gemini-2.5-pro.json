{"offer_from_A": ["Jordan Love", "Mike Evans"], "ask_from_B": ["Brock Bowers", "Breece Hall"], "reasoning": "This trade is a win-win that addresses both of our teams' primary needs. My team has a surplus of high-end QBs and WRs, while your roster could use an upgrade at both positions. I'm offering a top-10 QB in Jordan Love and a proven WR1 in Mike Evans to give your team two immediate, high-impact starters. In return, I'm looking to solve my biggest weakness at TE by acquiring the elite prospect Brock Bowers and upgrading my RB corps with a true workhorse in Breece Hall. You solidify your QB and WR rooms for the season, while I consolidate my depth into top-tier starters at TE and RB."}
