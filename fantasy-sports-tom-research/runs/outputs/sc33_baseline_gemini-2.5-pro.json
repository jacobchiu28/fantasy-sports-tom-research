{"offer_from_A": ["D'Andre Swift"], "ask_from_B": ["Rome Odunze"], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial positional swap. My roster has elite RB depth but needs help at WR. Your team is stacked at WR and can afford to move one for another starting-caliber RB. This trade gives me a much-needed WR2 in Odunze, and it adds another proven back in Swift to your already dominant RB room, providing incredible depth and insulation against injuries."}
