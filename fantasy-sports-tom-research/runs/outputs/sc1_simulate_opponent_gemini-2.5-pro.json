{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers"], "rationale": "Team A leverages its elite quarterback depth by trading Joe Burrow, a surplus asset given they also have Josh Allen. In return, they acquire a high-upside rookie WR in Malik Nabers, addressing their biggest positional need. Team B is in desperate need of a QB upgrade, and acquiring a top-tier player like Burrow instantly transforms their team from a pretender to a contender. They can afford to part with Nabers given their other receiving talent like Mike Evans and Brian Thomas Jr."}
