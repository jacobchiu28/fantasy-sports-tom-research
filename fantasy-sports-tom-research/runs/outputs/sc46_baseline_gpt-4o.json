{"offer_from_A": ["Najee Harris", "Darnell Mooney"], "ask_from_B": ["David Montgomery", "Khalil Shakir"], "reasoning": "Team A is looking to strengthen its RB and WR positions. Trading Najee Harris and Darnell Mooney, who have lower projections, for David Montgomery and Khalil Shakir, who have higher projections, improves Team A's overall scoring potential.
