{"offer_from_A": ["Dak Prescott", "Joe Mixon"], "ask_from_B": ["Sam LaPorta", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "Team A has elite QB depth but is extremely weak at TE, making an upgrade a top priority. Team B has two excellent TEs and incredible RB depth but lacks a solid QB1. This trade allows Team A to leverage a surplus QB to acquire an elite TE in Sam LaPorta, while Team B solidifies its biggest positional need with Dak Prescott by trading from positions of strength. The RB swap balances the value, making it a mutually beneficial deal."}
