{"offer_from_A": ["Jonathan Taylor", "Davante Adams"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Jonathan Taylor (RB, 16.2) and Davante Adams (WR, 13.4) for Bijan Robinson (RB, 18.5) and Tee Higgins (WR, 14.4). This trade benefits both teams: A upgrades at both RB and WR positions, while B maintains strong RB depth and gets a proven WR1 in Adams. B likely accepts as they still have strong RB options and improve WR corps. Trade is fair in projected points and addresses needs for both teams."}
