{"offer_from_A": ["Aaron Jones Sr.", "George Pickens", "Kyle Pitts Sr."], "ask_from_B": ["Kenneth Walker III", "Drake London", "Tucker Kraft"], "reasoning": "This trade addresses needs for both teams. Team A upgrades at RB with Walker III, who has a higher projection than Jones. They also get a slight upgrade at WR with London over Pickens. Team B improves their TE situation significantly with Pitts, addressing a weak spot. Jones provides solid RB depth for Team B, while Pickens offers WR potential. The trade is balanced in terms of projected points and positional value, making it likely for Team B to accept."}
