{"offer_from_A": ["Joe Burrow", "Zay Flowers"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara", "Stefon Diggs"], "reasoning": "Team A has a surplus of elite QBs and high-end WRs, while its RB depth behind Saquon Barkley is a major weakness. Team B is exceptionally deep at RB but could use an upgrade at both QB and WR. This trade allows Team A to acquire a top-tier RB in Alvin Kamara by leveraging its QB depth with Joe Burrow, a significant upgrade for Team B. The WR swap gives Team B a younger receiver with a higher projection in Zay Flowers, while Team A receives a proven veteran in Stefon Diggs, balancing the overall value and addressing key needs for both teams."}
