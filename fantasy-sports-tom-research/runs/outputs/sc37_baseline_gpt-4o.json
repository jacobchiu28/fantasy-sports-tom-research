{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Darren Waller"], "ask_from_B": ["Kyren Williams", "George Kittle"], "reasoning": "Team A is trading Josh Jacobs, a high-value RB, and Darren Waller, a solid TE, to acquire Kyren Williams, who has a similar RB projection, and George Kittle, an upgrade at TE. This trade balances Team A's roster by maintaining RB strength while improving the TE position."}
