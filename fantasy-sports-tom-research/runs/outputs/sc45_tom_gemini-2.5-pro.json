{"offer_from_A": ["Dak Prescott", "Jerome Ford"], "ask_from_B": ["Sam LaPorta", "Aaron Jones Sr."], "reasoning": "This trade is mutually beneficial as Team A addresses its critical need for an elite TE by acquiring Sam LaPorta, while trading from its significant QB depth. Team B receives a major QB upgrade in Dak Prescott and a reliable starting RB in Jerome Ford, allowing them to capitalize on their TE surplus (they still roster Dallas Goedert) and swap an aging RB."}
