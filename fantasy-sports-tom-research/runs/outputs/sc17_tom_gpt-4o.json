{"offer_from_A": ["James Conner", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A offers James Conner, a high-projection RB, and Chris Godwin, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Tee Higgins. Team B has a strong RB lineup with Bijan Robinson and Saquon Barkley, making Conner a valuable depth addition without losing much. Team B also gains Godwin to bolster their WR depth. Team A receives Tee Higgins, enhancing their WR core with a high-projection player, addressing their need for a top-tier WR. This trade balances both teams' strengths and needs, making it mutually beneficial."}
