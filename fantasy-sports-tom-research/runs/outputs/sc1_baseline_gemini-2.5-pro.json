{"offer_from_A": ["Justin Herbert", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["CeeDee Lamb", "Jake Ferguson"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to acquire a true WR1 in CeeDee Lamb, its primary need. Trading Herbert is feasible with Josh Allen, Fields, and Goff remaining. For Team B, this trade provides a franchise QB in Herbert, shoring up their weakest position, and a strong replacement WR in McLaurin, creating a more balanced roster without a catastrophic drop-off in production. Ferguson is a value balancer Team B can afford to lose with Brock Bowers emerging."}
