{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tyler Lockett"], "ask_from_B": ["Jahmyr Gibbs", "Jalen Tolbert"], "reasoning": "Team A trades depth at RB for a higher-upside player in Gibbs, while addressing Team B's need for a reliable WR2. Jacobs provides immediate RB1 value to Team B, offsetting the loss of Gibbs. Lockett offers a steady veteran presence for Team B's WR corps. Team A improves its RB potential with Gibbs' dual-threat ability, while Tolbert is a low-risk addition. This trade balances both teams' needs and values, making it appealing for Team B to accept."}
