{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Chris Godwin"], "ask_from_B": ["D'Andre Swift", "George Pickens"], "reasoning": "Team A upgrades at RB with Swift (11.4 proj) over Stevenson (10.3 proj), while addressing Team B's WR depth need by offering Godwin. Team B improves WR corps with Godwin's potential upside and gets a solid RB in Stevenson. The trade is balanced, addressing needs for both teams without significantly disrupting their roster strengths."}
