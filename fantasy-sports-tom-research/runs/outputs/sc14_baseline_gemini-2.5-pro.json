{"offer_from_A": ["Tua Tagovailoa", "David Montgomery"], "ask_from_B": ["Sam LaPorta", "Tony Pollard"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its significant QB surplus to address a major weakness at tight end. By trading Tua Tagovailoa and David Montgomery, Team A acquires an elite TE in Sam LaPorta from Team B's TE logjam and a comparable RB in Tony Pollard. This move consolidates Team A's bench depth into a significant starting lineup upgrade. Team B benefits by converting a redundant high-end TE into valuable depth at RB and a high-quality backup QB, improving their overall roster flexibility."}
