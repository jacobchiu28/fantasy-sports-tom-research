{"offer_from_A": ["Xavier Worthy", "James Conner"], "ask_from_B": ["Saquon Barkley", "Cooper Kupp"], "reasoning": "Team A proposes this trade to acquire an elite running back by leveraging its WR depth. Team B's roster is desperate for a top-tier WR, and Xavier Worthy (14.9 proj) immediately becomes their WR1. James Conner (14.1 proj) provides them with another high-end RB. In return, Team A gets the elite RB they need in Saquon Barkley (19.3 proj) to pair with Derrick Henry, and also receives a quality WR in Cooper Kupp (11.1 proj) to maintain a strong receiving corps alongside CeeDee Lamb. This is a classic strength-for-strength trade that addresses the primary needs of both teams."}
