{"offer_from_A": ["Rhamondre Stevenson", "Brandin Cooks"], "ask_from_B": ["Alvin Kamara"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Rhamondre Stevenson and Brandin Cooks to Team B in exchange for Alvin Kamara. Team A has a surplus of RBs and WRs, allowing them to part with Stevenson and Cooks. Kamara provides a high-upside RB option for Team A, complementing their existing RBs. Team B receives a solid RB in Stevenson to bolster their depth and a WR in Cooks to strengthen their weaker WR lineup. This trade addresses Team B's need for more depth and balance across positions, making it a fair and mutually beneficial exchange."}
