{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Nico Collins"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a high-performing RB, and Nico Collins, a strong WR, to acquire Bijan Robinson, an elite RB with a slightly higher projection. This trade consolidates Team A's RB strength with a younger, high-upside player, while Team B gains depth with a top RB and a valuable WR."}
