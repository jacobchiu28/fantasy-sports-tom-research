{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Michael Pittman Jr."], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Baker Mayfield, a high-projection QB, and Michael Pittman Jr., a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for James Conner, a strong RB. Team B has depth at RB but could use an upgrade at QB, where Baker Mayfield offers a higher projection than their current options. Additionally, Michael Pittman Jr. strengthens Team B's WR depth. Team A, on the other hand, improves their RB position with James Conner, addressing a need for higher-projection RBs. This trade is mutually beneficial as it addresses Team B's QB and WR needs while enhancing Team A's RB lineup."}
