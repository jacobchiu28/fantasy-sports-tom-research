{"offer_from_A": ["Trevor Lawrence", "Rhamondre Stevenson"], "ask_from_B": ["Malik Nabers", "Brian Robinson Jr."], "rationale": "Your biggest need is a reliable, high-upside QB1 to pair with Stroud, and Trevor Lawrence fits that perfectly, giving you elite stability at the position. You can make this move by dealing from your strengths. While Nabers is a great prospect, your WR room remains stacked with Harrison Jr. and Ridley. Swapping Brian Robinson Jr. for a comparable RB in Rhamondre Stevenson makes this a clean, need-based trade that significantly strengthens your starting lineup where it counts the most."}
