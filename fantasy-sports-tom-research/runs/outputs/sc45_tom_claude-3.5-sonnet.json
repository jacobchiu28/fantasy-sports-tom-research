{"offer_from_A": ["Josh Jacobs", "Tee Higgins"], "ask_from_B": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Quentin Johnston"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Josh Jacobs (RB, 15.5 proj) and Tee Higgins (WR, 14.4 proj) for Christian McCaffrey (RB, 18.6 proj) and Quentin Johnston (WR, 6.3 proj). This trade benefits both teams: Team A upgrades at RB with the elite McCaffrey while maintaining WR depth. Team B improves WR corps with Higgins and gets a solid RB in Jacobs to offset losing McCaffrey. B likely accepts as they gain value at WR, a position of need, while still having a strong RB. The trade is balanced in projected points and addresses needs for both teams."}
