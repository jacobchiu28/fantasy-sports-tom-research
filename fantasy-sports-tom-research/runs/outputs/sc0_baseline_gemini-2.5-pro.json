{"offer_from_A": ["Baker Mayfield", "Terry McLaurin"], "ask_from_B": ["De'Von Achane", "Stefon Diggs"], "reasoning": "Team A addresses its biggest need by acquiring an elite, high-upside RB in Achane while adding a top WR in Diggs. Team B solves its glaring QB weakness with Mayfield, a significant upgrade, and gets a reliable WR1 in McLaurin. Team B can afford to move an RB due to its exceptional depth, making this a mutually beneficial deal that targets both teams' primary weaknesses."}
