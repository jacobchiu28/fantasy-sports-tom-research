{"offer_from_A": ["Puka Nacua", "Jake Ferguson"], "ask_from_B": ["Trey McBride", "Deebo Samuel Sr."], "reasoning": "This is a mutually beneficial trade addressing key needs. Team A upgrades significantly at TE with the elite Trey McBride, creating a major positional advantage, while still receiving a quality WR2 in Deebo Samuel. Team A can make this move due to strong WR depth in Malik Nabers and Courtland Sutton. Team B solves its most critical weakness by acquiring a true #1 WR in Puka Nacua. While they lose McBride, they have an excellent replacement in Dalton Kincaid, making this an easy sacrifice to fix their receiving corps."}
