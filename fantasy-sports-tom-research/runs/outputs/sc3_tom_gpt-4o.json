{"offer_from_A": ["Derrick Henry", "Christian Kirk"], "ask_from_B": ["Bijan Robinson"], "reasoning": "Team A offers Derrick Henry, a high-performing RB, and Christian Kirk, a solid WR, to Team B in exchange for Bijan Robinson. Team B has a surplus of strong RBs, including Jahmyr Gibbs and Alvin Kamara, and can afford to trade Robinson. In return, they receive Henry, who is comparable in performance, and Kirk, which strengthens their WR depth, addressing their weaker WR lineup. This trade balances both teams' rosters, enhancing Team A's RB position with a younger, high-upside player while giving Team B a more balanced roster."}
