{"offer_from_A": ["J.K. Dobbins", "Dalton Schultz"], "ask_from_B": ["James Conner"], "reasoning": "Team A offers J.K. Dobbins, a solid RB with potential upside, and Dalton Schultz, a reliable TE, to Team B. Team B receives a boost in their TE position, which is currently weaker compared to Team A's depth at TE. In return, Team A receives James Conner, a high-projection RB, to strengthen their RB lineup. This trade benefits Team B by improving their TE position while maintaining RB depth, and Team A gains a more consistent RB option, addressing their need for a higher-projection RB."}
