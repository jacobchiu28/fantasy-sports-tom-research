{"offer_from_A": ["Alvin Kamara", "DK Metcalf"], "ask_from_B": ["Tyreek Hill", "D'Andre Swift"], "reasoning": "Team A acquires a true elite WR1 in Tyreek Hill, its biggest need, while receiving a quality replacement RB in D'Andre Swift. Team B has incredible RB depth and can easily absorb moving Swift. In return, they get a comparable top-tier RB in Alvin Kamara and a solid WR2 in DK Metcalf to pair with Justin Jefferson, balancing both rosters effectively."}
