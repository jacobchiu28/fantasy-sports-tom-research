{"offer_from_A": ["Jalen Hurts"], "ask_from_B": ["D'Andre Swift", "Tee Higgins"], "reasoning": "Team A leverages its elite QB depth to address its primary weakness at RB and further strengthen its WR corps. Jalen Hurts is a massive upgrade for Team B's weakest position. In return, Team A acquires a dependable starting RB in D'Andre Swift and a top-tier WR in Tee Higgins, creating a more balanced and formidable roster while still having the high-upside Jayden Daniels to start at QB. Team B solves its QB problem while retaining its top RB, Kenneth Walker III, and other star WRs."}
