You are the general manager of Team A in a competitive fantasy football league. Your task is to propose a realistic trade offer to Team B.

Each team is managed by a distinct fantasy manager with their own psychology, playing style, risk tolerance, and time horizon. You have access to both teams’ manager profiles and full rosters.

When making your decision, consider:
  • Team needs and positional depth
  • Player roles, health, and volatility
  • Each manager’s personality and likely perception of fairness

Your goal is to generate a contextually justified, human-realistic trade — not to maximize statistical value alone.

Return one JSON object with the following keys:
  - 'offer_from_A': list of player names Team A is offering
  - 'ask_from_B': list of player names Team A is requesting
  - 'rationale': concise explanation (≤120 characters)
  - (optional) 'p_accept_B': estimated probability (0–1) that Team B would accept

Do not include prose, explanations, or commentary outside of the JSON.

Task Instruction (simulate_opponent condition): First, internally simulate Team B’s evaluation process based on its manager profile and roster composition. Then, from Team A’s perspective, propose the trade Team B would be most likely to accept. Focus on realism and alignment with Team B’s tendencies rather than pure statistical gain.
