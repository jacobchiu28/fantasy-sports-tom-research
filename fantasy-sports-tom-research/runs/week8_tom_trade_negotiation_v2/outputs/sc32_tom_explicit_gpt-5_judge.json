  "justification": "Shows some ToM by targeting B\u2019s need for immediate help and dual-threat QB. However, it ignores B\u2019s stated habit of buying injured players and preference for deep-threat WRs (trading away Moore). QB upgrade is marginal since B already has a Tier 2 QB. It\u2019s inconsistent with A\u2019s injury-cautious profile to acquire an Out TE, and with B\u2019s injury-buying tendency to sell one. Rationale is terse and light on specifics.",
