  "justification": "Identifies Team B\u2019s desire for stable workloads, but ignores their reliance on expert consensus and the massive value gap (Tier 5 RB for a Tier 1 RB plus WR). Robinson\u2019s mid volatility in a run-heavy/low-pass offense also clashes with B\u2019s stated fades. The offer heavily favors A and the 0.6 acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is brief and not grounded in tiers, roles, or B\u2019s incentives, yielding weak ToM and poor internal coherence.",
