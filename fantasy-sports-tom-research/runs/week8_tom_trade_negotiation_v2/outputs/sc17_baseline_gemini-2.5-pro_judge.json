  "justification": "The proposal centers on Team A\u2019s desire to get a dual\u2011threat QB and ignores Team B\u2019s perspective. Team B is 0-8, values dual\u2011threat QBs, and James Jones is their only healthy QB; no replacement QB is offered. While Ryan Taylor is elite, the deal leaves B without a starter at QB and clashes with their archetype preferences. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives, making acceptance unlikely.",
