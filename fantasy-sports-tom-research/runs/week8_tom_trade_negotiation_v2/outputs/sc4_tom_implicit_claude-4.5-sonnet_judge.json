  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s appetite for upside via a young RB, but ignores B\u2019s QB-WR stack preference and comfort buying injured players. The \u2018rookie stack potential\u2019 claim is incorrect, and A\u2019s injury caution clashes with targeting a Questionable RB. Trade is feasible but value tilts toward A (Tier 5 WR for B\u2019s Tier 2). Rationale is brief and not evidence-based.",
