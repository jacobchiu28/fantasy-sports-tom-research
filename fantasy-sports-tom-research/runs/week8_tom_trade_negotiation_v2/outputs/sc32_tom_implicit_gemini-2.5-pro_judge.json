  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s urgency but ignores that Robinson is doubtful and thus not a \u201cwin-now\u201d starter. Doesn\u2019t engage B\u2019s stated preferences (consensus rankings, QB/WR stacks, dual-threat QBs) beyond generic claims. Trade logic is incoherent for A: sending a Tier 1 WR (Torres) plus an RB for a Tier 3 WR (Moore) contradicts \u201cconsolidating depth.\u201d Rationale is vague and mismatched to player statuses and value. While B might accept due to surplus value, the ToM reasoning is shallow and inconsistent.",
