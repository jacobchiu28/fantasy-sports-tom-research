  "justification": "Poor modeling of Team B: they prefer consistency and healthy players, yet are offered a mid-variance WR and asked to surrender their possession WR. Value isn\u2019t similar\u2014A parts with a Tier 1 RB and Tier 1 WR for B\u2019s Tier 3 RB/WR. The move also contradicts Team A\u2019s injury-averse profile by targeting two Questionable players. Rationale is generic and overlooks tiers, roles, injuries, and each side\u2019s urgent needs, making the proposal incoherent for A and only incidentally appealing for B.",
