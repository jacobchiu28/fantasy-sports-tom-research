  "justification": "Offer targets B\u2019s upside preference with a dual-threat QB and an ascending WR, fitting B\u2019s 8-0 risk tolerance and IR QB situation. A receives a low-volatility RB and a pocket passer, matching A\u2019s conservative style. Trade pieces and roles are coherent, and values are plausible (A may overpay slightly, boosting B acceptance). Rationale is accurate but thin, lacking specifics about B\u2019s IR QB need and A\u2019s injury aversion.",
