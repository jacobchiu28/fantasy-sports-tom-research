  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s consensus-driven mindset and appeal of a high-ceiling WR, but overassumes RB depth and overlooks B\u2019s preference for rookie upside (Darian Campbell ascending). The swap is coherent: A seeks RB help, B gains a Tier 1 WR, and injuries aren\u2019t a concern. However, the rationale barely addresses A\u2019s motivations and ignores potential bye/roster ripple effects. Clear but too brief and shallow.",
