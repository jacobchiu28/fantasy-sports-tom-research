  "justification": "Fails to account for Team B's love of workhorse RBs and need for healthy, consistent players; asks for B's top workhorse Ryan Taylor while offering a Tier 3 dual-threat QB (not B's preference) and a doubtful deep-threat WR. Misdiagnoses Team A\u2019s weakness\u2014A already has multiple Tier 1 RBs; WR/TE are weaker. Reasoning centers on A only, with minimal ToM. Trade is technically feasible but poorly aligned with both teams\u2019 contexts; acceptance odds overstated.",
