  "justification": "After correcting the roster mistake, the proposal still ignores Team B\u2019s mindset: B is injury\u2011cautious and already QB-deep, yet A offers an Out QB; B also prefers young ascending players with playoff advantage, making Isaiah Thompson a core hold. The ask mismatches B\u2019s values and consensus tendencies. Coherence is marginally acceptable but optimistic on acceptance. Rationale is brief, A-centric, and lacks evidence about B\u2019s incentives or constraints.",
