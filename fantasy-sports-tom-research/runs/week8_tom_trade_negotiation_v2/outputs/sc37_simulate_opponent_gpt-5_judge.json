  "justification": "Attempts ToM by noting A\u2019s QB need and B\u2019s desire for steadiness, but misreads B: Torres is a deep-threat with mid variance (not \u201csteadier\u201d), and B prefers stable, volume WRs. It wrongly calls Lucas Carter a stable starter despite being Out, and undervalues B\u2019s reliance on Chris Lee (low-variance QB) for a conservative manager. Trade is feasible but lopsided and rationale is factually inconsistent and thin.",
