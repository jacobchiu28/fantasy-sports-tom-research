  "justification": "Proposal centers on A\u2019s upgrade with little modeling of B\u2019s beliefs. B needs wins now, values high-upside dual-threat QBs, and trusts consensus\u2014trading away Tier 2 Chris Adams for Tier 4 Isaiah Lee plus an injured committee RB doesn\u2019t fit B\u2019s incentives. A already has a stable Tier 2 pocket passer (David Nelson) and prefers pocket QBs, making the target somewhat misaligned. The offer is feasible roster-wise but unlikely to be accepted. Rationale is generic and omits B\u2019s motivations or player context.",
