  "justification": "Good recognition of B\u2019s urgent RB need, WR surplus, and TE depth, and separates A\u2019s playoff aims from B\u2019s short-term priorities. However, it overlooks B\u2019s stated fade of run-heavy offenses while sending them Justin Young from a low-volume passing offense, and over-infers a preference for veterans. Value-wise, B giving up a Tier 1 WR (Thompson) for a Tier 3 RB plus a Tier 2 WR seems optimistic, and the TE \u201cupgrade\u201d for A is marginal. Reasoning is clear but slightly misaligned with B\u2019s preferences.",
