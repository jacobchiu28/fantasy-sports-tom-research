  "justification": "Cites B\u2019s preference for consistency but then asks B to give up their workhorse RB for a volatile RB and a young, high-variance WR\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s values. Little separation of A\u2019s playoff push from B\u2019s incentives/needs (e.g., B\u2019s TE weakness unaddressed). Trade is feasible but contextually weak for B\u2019s roster and strategy. Rationale is brief and somewhat contradictory; acceptance probability appears overstated.",
