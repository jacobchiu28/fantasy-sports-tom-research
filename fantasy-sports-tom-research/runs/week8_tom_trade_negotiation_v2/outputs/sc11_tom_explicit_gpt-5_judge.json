  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s 0-8 urgency and preference for stability and pocket QB, but misreads specifics: B values workhorse RBs and high-consistency pieces; offered RB is a committee Tier 4 and TE has low usage consistency. Trading a Tier 1 QB plus a Tier 2 possession WR for three middling assets is lopsided. Minimal rationale, no discussion of TE injuries, buy-low tendencies, or playoff schedules. Probability of acceptance is overstated.",
