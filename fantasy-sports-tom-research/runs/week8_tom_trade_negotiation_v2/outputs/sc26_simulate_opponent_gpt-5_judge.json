  "justification": "Rationale is generic and misses key beliefs. Team A is conservative and values workhorse RBs; trading a Tier 1 RB for an injured TE undermines A\u2019s floor. Calling Tyler Anderson a \u201cstability\u201d upgrade ignores his Doubtful status. Team B likes upside and buys injured players, so selling their established Tier 1 TE isn\u2019t well-motivated, though RB need exists. The offer is feasible but misaligned with profiles, and the explanation lacks scenario-specific detail.",
