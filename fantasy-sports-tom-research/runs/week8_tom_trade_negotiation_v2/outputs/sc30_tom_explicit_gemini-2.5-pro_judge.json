  "justification": "It correctly identifies Team B\u2019s urgency and RB need, offering two Tier 3 RBs for a surplus TE. However, it ignores B\u2019s TE depth, single-RB roster specifics, and consensus-driven preference for immediate impact (might prefer a higher-tier RB). A/B motives aren\u2019t clearly separated. The trade is coherent and plausibly attractive to B, though the acceptance probability seems a bit optimistic. Rationale is brief and generic.",
