  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s preference for consistency and RB stability; trading a Tier 1 RB (Noah Carter) weakens an 8-0 roster\u2019s safest floor. Liam Wright is Tier 1 but a deep-threat in a low-volume offense (higher variance), misaligned with B\u2019s tastes. Michael Roberts (Tier 4) is only a marginal TE upgrade. Rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s actual incentives or playoff matchups, and p_accept is overstated. Good for A\u2019s RB need, poor fit for B.",
