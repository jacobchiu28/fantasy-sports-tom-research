  "justification": "Minimal ToM: it frames B as wanting \u201clow-variance vets,\u201d contrary to B\u2019s upside/young preference. It ignores B\u2019s WR need but doesn\u2019t articulate it. Internal inconsistencies: labels Cameron Scott (a rookie) as a vet and A asks for two committee/high-variance RBs despite A\u2019s stated workhorse/consistency bias. Feasible structurally, but rationale is generic and thin, misstates schedules (only Campbell noted friendly playoffs) and offers little evidence B would accept beyond a vague value swap.",
