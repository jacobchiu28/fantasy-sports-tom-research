  "justification": "Team B (7-1, conservative, consensus-driven) won\u2019t give a Tier 1 RB (even with a declining role) for a Tier 5 WR and a marginal TE upgrade. They value workhorse RBs and possession WRs; Martinez isn\u2019t a possession WR and Turner isn\u2019t a clear TE upgrade over their Tier 4. Rationale is internally inconsistent (\u201cstable veteran RB\u201d going to B) and probability is unrealistic. Minimal evidence of B\u2019s perspective.",
