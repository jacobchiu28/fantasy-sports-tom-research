  "justification": "Rationale barely considers Team B\u2019s mindset (conservative, rankings-driven, playoff schedule). It labels Austin Reed a backup despite being a Tier 1 QB, undermining credibility. While the swap is feasible and gives B a floor-stable pocket passer upgrade, it ignores B\u2019s likely reluctance to surrender RB depth with a friendly playoff schedule. Explanation is generic and A-centric with limited evidence.",
