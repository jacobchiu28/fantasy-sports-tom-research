  "justification": "Shows basic awareness that B needs win-now pieces, but ignores B\u2019s stated preference for workhorse RBs and their acute TE need. Treats Sam Lewis as a stable RB1 for A (fits A\u2019s conservative style), but doesn\u2019t explain why B would surrender their most reliable RB. Reasoning is brief and generic, lacking details on roles, volatility, or playoff schedules. Trade is feasible and coherent, but ToM depth is limited.",
