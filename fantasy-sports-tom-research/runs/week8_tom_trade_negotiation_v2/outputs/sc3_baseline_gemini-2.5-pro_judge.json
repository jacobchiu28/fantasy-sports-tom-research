  "justification": "A\u2019s rationale is A-centric (TE upgrade, playoff schedule) and ignores B\u2019s preferences (dual-threat QBs, rookies, playoff schedule focus) and B\u2019s TE scarcity. It also conflicts with A\u2019s injury-averse profile by targeting a Doubtful TE. While a WR-for-TE swap is structurally plausible, it\u2019s weakly aligned with both managers\u2019 incentives and fails to argue why B would part with a TE with a friendly playoff schedule. Explanation is brief and generic.",
