B\u2019s Josh Robinson has a friendly playoff schedule and workhorse role, aligning with B\u2019s values; A offers an injured RB (Alex King), a volatile committee RB (Caleb Turner) with tough playoffs, and a deep-threat WR (Cameron Holt) with tough playoffs\u2014poor fit for B. Rationale is brief and A-centric despite a modest p_accept. Trade is feasible but poorly tailored to B.",
