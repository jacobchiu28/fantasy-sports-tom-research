  "justification": "Acknowledges B might like a dual-threat QB with good playoff schedule, but misses B\u2019s glaring QB need, consensus-driven style, and injury aversion explicitly. Does separate A\u2019s desire for volatile RBs from B\u2019s incentives, albeit briefly. Trade is feasible and roster-coherent (A has another Tier 2 QB; B upgrades from no usable QB), though value is lopsided. Rationale is thin and asserts fairness without support.",
