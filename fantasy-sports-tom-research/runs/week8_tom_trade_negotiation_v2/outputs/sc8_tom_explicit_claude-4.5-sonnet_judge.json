  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s values: offers them a mid-variance deep threat and a committee RB, while B prefers workhorse RBs and possession WRs. Ignores Team A\u2019s injury aversion by asking them to take two Questionable players. A also downgrades massively from a healthy Tier 1 RB (Carter) to a Tier 3 RB (Reed), conflicting with their urgent win/consistency needs. Rationale is terse and doesn\u2019t address injuries, workloads, or roster impacts. Acceptance probability seems unjustified.",
