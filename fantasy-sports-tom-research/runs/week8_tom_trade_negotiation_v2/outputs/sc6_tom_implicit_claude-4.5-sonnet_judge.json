  "justification": "Fails to model B\u2019s needs: B values dual\u2011threat QBs and is 0-8; trading away their only healthy dual\u2011threat (Jones) for a pocket QB hurts their identity and win-now outlook. Asking for Eric Torres (Tier 1, healthy) while offering two rookies (Tier 3 and Tier 5) is unlikely to appeal, despite B liking rookies. No mention of B\u2019s injury aversion or roster impact. The trade is technically feasible but strategically lopsided toward A. p_accept_B=0.62 is unrealistic.",
