  "justification": "Identifies Team B\u2019s WR surplus and playoff-schedule interest, but misses B\u2019s consensus-driven nature implying near-auto accept for a Tier 1 RB + TE for a Tier 4 WR (p_accept likely far higher). Poor separation of A\u2019s needs: A is 2-6 and trades away its Tier 1 RB, undermining urgent win-now goals. Kyle Taylor isn\u2019t a deep-threat, only a Tier 4 outside WR, mismatching A\u2019s stated preferences. The offer is lopsided and unrealistic from A\u2019s side. Rationale is brief and lacks concrete, player-tier evidence.",
