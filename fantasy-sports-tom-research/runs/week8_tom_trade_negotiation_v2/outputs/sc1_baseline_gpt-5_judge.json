  "justification": "Offer ignores B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven preferences. Trading Flores (steady touches, friendly playoff slate) guts B\u2019s RB floor, while Eric Torres is a volatile deep threat with tough playoff matchups and inconsistent targets\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s values. Trevor Roberts is redundant behind B\u2019s Tier 1 QB. TE swap (Liam Adams) is marginal; not a meaningful sweetener. Rationale focuses only on A\u2019s needs; no case for B. Internally feasible but poorly targeted to B\u2019s incentives.",
