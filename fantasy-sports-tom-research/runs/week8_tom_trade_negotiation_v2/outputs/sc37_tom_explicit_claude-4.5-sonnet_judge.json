  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s QB surplus and conservative style, but misreads B\u2019s WR preferences (offers two volatile deep threats, not possession targets) and undervalues Sean Hernandez (Tier 1 RB). Claims both WRs have friendly playoff schedules (only Justin does) and labels them as possession-like. Asking B to part with a top RB plus an injured QB for low-tier WRs conflicts with B\u2019s consensus-driven, volume-first mindset. A\u2019s motives fit (injured dual-threat QB), but B\u2019s acceptance is unlikely.",
