  "justification": "Recognizes Thomas as a consistent possession WR and mentions B\u2019s contrarian streak, but ignores B\u2019s clear preference for proven, low-variance veterans and caution around injuries. Asking B to give up his reliable possession WR for two volatile rookies conflicts with his stated values, especially at 1-7 needing bankable points. Little discussion of B\u2019s roster needs, injury/bye context, or A\u2019s motives. Trade is feasible on value but misaligned with B\u2019s mindset.",
