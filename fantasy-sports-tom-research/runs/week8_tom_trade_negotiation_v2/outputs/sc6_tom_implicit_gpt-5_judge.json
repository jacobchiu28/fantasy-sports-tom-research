  "justification": "Proposal recognizes B\u2019s need for immediate help and offers a clear TE upgrade plus RB depth, but it barely addresses B\u2019s injury aversion or dual\u2011threat QB preference and ignores B already having a healthy dual\u2011threat QB. The trade itself is coherent and plausible for B to accept, though A\u2019s urgency vs acquiring an Out QB is a mild inconsistency. Rationale is too generic.",
