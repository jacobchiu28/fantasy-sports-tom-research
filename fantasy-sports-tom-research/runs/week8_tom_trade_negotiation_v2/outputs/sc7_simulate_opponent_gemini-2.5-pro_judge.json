  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s taste for high-upside rookies, but ignores their urgent need for immediate production; offering an injured RB and a rookie with a declining role is misaligned. Says \u201cplayoff push\u201d for a 3\u20135 team. Also mismatched with Team A\u2019s conservative, floor-first profile by targeting another volatile deep threat. Value/tier logic is shaky (Tier 2 WR + injured RB for Tier 3 WR). Rationale is generic and thin; acceptance probability seems overstated.",
