  "justification": "Good nod to B\u2019s preference for reliable, possession targets and TE help, and A\u2019s desire for a volatile committee RB. However, it ignores B\u2019s veteran bias, playoff focus, and RB depth needs (trading away a Tier 3 RB leaves shaky depth). Michael Roberts may not be a true TE upgrade over Holt. Adam Anderson is a high-variance \u2018possession\u2019 fit, weakening the reliability premise. Rationale is too terse.",
