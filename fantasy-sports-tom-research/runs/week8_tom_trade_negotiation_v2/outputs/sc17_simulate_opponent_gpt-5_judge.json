  "justification": "Shows some ToM by offering B a clear TE upgrade and viable QB replacement, while noting A\u2019s need for dual\u2011threat upside. However, it underweights B\u2019s preference for dual\u2011threat/high\u2011upside QBs and urgency at 0\u20118\u2014\u201csafe\u201d QB depth may not appeal. The trade is coherent and injury\u2011averse, but rationale is brief and light on scenario\u2011specific details.",
