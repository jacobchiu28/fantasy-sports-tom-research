  "justification": "Asks injury-averse Team B to trade a Tier 1 RB for a Tier 5 RB plus an injured, volatile WR\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven preferences. The rationale mislabels Matt Wright (a deep-threat Tier 5) as a consistency upgrade. Little evidence of considering B\u2019s needs or incentives; focuses on A\u2019s RB upgrade. Internally inconsistent with A\u2019s floor preference by adding a low-floor WR. Acceptance probability is overstated.",
