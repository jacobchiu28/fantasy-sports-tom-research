  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: B already has a Tier 1 TE (no \u2018huge TE void\u2019) and values stable floors, making an injured, high-variance WR (Derek Harris) unattractive while needing wins now. Trading away a healthy, low-volatility RB (Ben King) hurts B\u2019s floor and RB depth. Rationale labels Harris as \u2018stable,\u2019 contradicting archetype and injury. Minimal, generic reasoning and inflated accept probability.",
