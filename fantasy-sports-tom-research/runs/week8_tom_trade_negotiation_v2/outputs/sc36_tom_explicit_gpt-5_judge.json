  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s ceiling-chasing and rankings trust and offers a dual-threat QB plus boom WR, aligning with preferences. But it neglects B\u2019s urgent need for wins: trading a Tier 1 workhorse (minor injury) for an Out QB and Doubtful WR hurts short-term outcomes. The explanation is terse and doesn\u2019t engage B\u2019s roster context (RB depth vs QB need) or timeline. Plausible but not well-tailored ToM.",
