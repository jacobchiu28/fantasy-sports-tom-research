  "justification": "It recognizes B\u2019s taste for dual-threat QBs/deep-threat WRs and contrarian tendencies, and A\u2019s injury-buy approach with Jordan Moore. However, it\u2019s shallow: it doesn\u2019t weigh B\u2019s RB scarcity after losing their lone Tier 1 RB, nor quantify the QB upgrade. It also underexplains A\u2019s urgent-win context and WR depth loss. The trade is plausible and coherent, but the acceptance probability feels optimistic given B\u2019s RB hit. Rationale is brief and generic.",
