  "justification": "Shows a basic read that B could want a high-upside RB, but overlooks B\u2019s already solid RB depth and bigger issues (QB/TE/WR). The offer is wildly imbalanced: A parts with a Tier 1 workhorse for a Tier 4 WR and an injured Tier 4 RB, clashing with A\u2019s consensus-driven style. Reasoning is brief and nonspecific; little evidence from tiers, roles, or schedules. B\u2019s accept chance is likely higher than stated.",
