It ignores B\u2019s preference for consistent, workhorse RBs and reliance on expert consensus; Michael Walker is a volatile committee back, and David Young is an uncertain injured QB. No mention of B\u2019s WR depth or injured-buy strategy. Calling Justin Young a \u201cstable\u201d upgrade misreads his deep-threat variance. Trade value is plausible but reasoning lacks ToM depth.",
