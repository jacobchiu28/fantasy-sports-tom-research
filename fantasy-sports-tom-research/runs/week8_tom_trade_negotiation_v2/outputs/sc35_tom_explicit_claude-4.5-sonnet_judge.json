  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s need for wins and preference for proven talent, but ignores B\u2019s injury aversion and playoff-schedule focus (Liam Carter already has a friendly slate). Trade asks B to give a Tier 2 RB for a Tier 3 WR and a questionable TE\u2014poor value and positional fit (B already has TEs). Mislabels Ben Miller as ascending while he\u2019s out. Limited separation of A vs B incentives and an unrealistically high accept probability. Rationale is brief and not evidence-based.",
