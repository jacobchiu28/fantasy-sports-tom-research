  "justification": "Trade suits Team A (Tier 1 QB upgrade, pass-catching TE), but shows little regard for Team B\u2019s mindset or needs. B likely values rookie Brandon Taylor and has TE injuries (Walker doubtful, Gonzalez Q), making Taylor crucial. Asking for B\u2019s Tier 1 QB plus that TE for an out Tier 4 QB and a Tier 4 WR is lopsided. Minimal rationale, no explicit modeling of B\u2019s risk/rookie preferences or stacking goals.",
