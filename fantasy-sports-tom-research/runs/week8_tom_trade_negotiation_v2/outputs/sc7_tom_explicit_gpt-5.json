They have dual-threat QB depth (Chris Adams + Sam Foster), so moving Sam for two upside pieces preserves starter quality while adding week-swing potential. Trade reduces B\u2019s Week 12 bye pile-up (Sam Foster, Justin Garcia, Michael Roberts, Justin Hernandez). Value feels fair by consensus: B receives a high-variance rookie WR (Michael Foster) and a young committee RB (Alex Mitchell) that match their style, while A gets a lower-variance QB and a steadier WR to fit a conservative, playoff-minded roster.",
