  "justification": "Proposal centers on stabilizing Team A and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-oriented preferences. It sends volatile assets (Thompson, Campbell) to a manager who avoids boom/bust, with no nod to B\u2019s preference for possession WRs or pocket passers. Trade is feasible but misaligned with A\u2019s needs (giving up a Tier 3 RB) and lacks evidence beyond playoff schedules. Rationale is brief and one-sided.",
