  "justification": "Correctly targets B\u2019s ceiling-seeking style with a dual-threat QB, but overstates B\u2019s \u2018desperate\u2019 QB need and ignores B\u2019s reliance on rankings (Wright is out and low-tier). Proposal clashes with A\u2019s injury-avoid stance by pursuing Q-tagged Josh Martin and with A\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs. Value is borderline for B to surrender a Tier 1 workhorse RB for a QB plus an injured, low-value TE. Rationale is brief and generic.",
