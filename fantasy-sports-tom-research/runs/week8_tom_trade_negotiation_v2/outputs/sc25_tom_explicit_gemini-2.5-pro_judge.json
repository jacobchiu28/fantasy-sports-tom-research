  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s title run but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB tendency and preference for rookies (giving up young Xavier Rodriguez). Misreads A\u2019s needs: A already has a Tier 1 TE (Adam Wilson), so \u2018critical TE need\u2019 is inaccurate. The swap downgrades A at RB and adds a low-value TE, while B already has adequate TEs. Rationale is brief and not grounded in roster/role context, playoff schedules, or byes. Overall ToM and internal coherence are weak.",
