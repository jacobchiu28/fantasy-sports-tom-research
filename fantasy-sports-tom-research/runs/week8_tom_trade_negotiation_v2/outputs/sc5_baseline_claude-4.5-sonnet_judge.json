  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-focused mindset and their value on workhorse RBs; Ryan Taylor is exactly their archetype. Return pieces are a questionable committee RB (Liam Green), a fringe committee RB (Trey Mitchell), and a low-tier, high-variance WR (Marcus Taylor), which don\u2019t match B\u2019s preferences (possession WR with steady targets, proven vets). Rationale centers only on Team A. Trade is structurally feasible as a 3-for-1 but misaligned with B\u2019s needs, making acceptance unlikely.",
