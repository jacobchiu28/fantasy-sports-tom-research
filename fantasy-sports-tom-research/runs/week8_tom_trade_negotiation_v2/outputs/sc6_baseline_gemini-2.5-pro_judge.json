  "justification": "Rationale focuses only on Team A\u2019s needs and ignores Team B\u2019s preferences (dual\u2011threat QBs, injury aversion) and roster context (already strong at RB). Calling James Jones a \u201csignificant upgrade\u201d over Kevin Flores is dubious since both are Tier 3. The trade is feasible, and adding a Tier 1 RB could tempt B, but it conflicts with B\u2019s stated QB preferences and urgency. Explanation lacks concrete, two-sided reasoning.",
