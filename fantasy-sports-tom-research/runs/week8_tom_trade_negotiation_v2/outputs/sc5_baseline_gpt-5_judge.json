The proposal claims an upgrade at TE but trades away a healthy Tier 1 TE (Thomas) for an out Tier 5 TE (Justin Wright), contradicting roster facts and A\u2019s stated preferences. No rationale for why conservative Team B would accept beyond obvious windfall, and B\u2019s profile isn\u2019t referenced. Explanation is brief and factually incorrect.",
