  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s mindset: they like upside committee backs and need immediate wins; this deal actually helps B far more than the model anticipates. The rationale is A-centric and misvalues players\u2014trading a Tier 1 (Carter) and Tier 2 (Harris) plus Williams for a Tier 5 workhorse is not a \u201cbig upgrade\u201d for A. The offer is feasible but internally inconsistent with tiers/roles. No discussion of injuries, bye weeks, or playoff schedules. Acceptance probability is likely much higher than stated.",
