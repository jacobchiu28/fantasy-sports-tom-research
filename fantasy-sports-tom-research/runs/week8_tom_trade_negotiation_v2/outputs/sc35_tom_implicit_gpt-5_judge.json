  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s interest in established talent and friendly playoff schedules and addresses B\u2019s QB/WR needs by dealing from RB depth. Separates aims (A consolidates into upside RB), but misses B\u2019s urgency for immediate wins and contrarian tendencies. Trade is roster-coherent, though A losing its only fully healthy top QB conflicts with A\u2019s injury-cautious profile. Rationale is concise but light on specifics.",
