**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B is 3-5 and desperate for wins NOW. Their manager favors high-upside boom/bust players but also trusts expert consensus. Key insights:

1. **QB situation**: B has two dual-threat QBs but both have variance. David Nelson (low volatility pocket passer, veteran, mixed schedule) provides the stable weekly floor that could help B secure immediate wins while maintaining their Sam Foster upside option.

2. **WR depth**: B is loaded with volatile deep threats and high-variance receivers. Caleb Foster (possession WR, mid volatility, veteran) adds the consistent target floor B lacks for must-win weeks.

3. **What B gives up**: Sean Holt (high volatility committee RB, young, tough playoff schedule) and Matt Wright (mid volatility deep threat rookie, mixed schedule) fit B's usual profile BUT both have tough/mixed schedules and high variance - risky for a team needing wins now.

4. **Fairness perception**: B trusts expert rankings. Nelson is a proven veteran QB (consensus safe), Foster is a reliable possession receiver. B gets immediate-impact stability while giving up boom/bust pieces that haven't delivered wins. The "buying low on injured" comfort means B won't overvalue their struggling assets.

5. **Why B accepts**: Desperate teams often pivot from their usual strategy. B needs floors to win now, not ceilings for playoffs they might miss. This trade offers that pivot while A gets the high-upside pieces that align with buying low on volatility.
