  "justification": "Acknowledges B might want a workhorse with a friendly playoff slate, but ignores B\u2019s preference for high-upside deep-threat WRs and buying low on injured players (they\u2019re giving up Alex King). B\u2019s RB depth is already strong while WR depth is thinner, so losing Trevor Martin for a Tier 5 slot WR plus a Tier 5 RB is misaligned. A\u2019s aim to upgrade WR is coherent, but the rationale is superficial and lacks roster/injury context. Feasible trade, but weak ToM and optimistic accept probability.",
