  "justification": "It notes Team B\u2019s appetite for ceiling and rookies, but ignores B\u2019s comfort buying low on injured stars (making them less eager to swap Josh Martin). It misreads Team A\u2019s preferences: A is injury-averse yet targets a Questionable RB and doesn\u2019t gain a possession WR. The \u201cconsistency + friendly schedule\u201d claim is thin (only Torres has friendly playoffs; Martin is mixed). Trade is feasible but lopsided and poorly justified.",
