  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s appetite for ceiling via dual-threat QB and deep-threat WR, but ignores B\u2019s urgent need for immediate points; both incoming pieces are out/doubtful. Overlooks A\u2019s stated avoidance of injury concerns while targeting a Questionable workhorse. Value/timeline mismatch makes B unlikely to part with a Tier 1 RB now. Rationale is brief and generic, lacking specifics on statuses, roster fit, and timing. Acceptance probability seems optimistic.",
