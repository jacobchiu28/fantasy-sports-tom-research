  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s beliefs and needs: B values dual-threat QBs and avoids injury risk, yet A asks for B\u2019s only healthy dual-threat QB while offering a pocket QB plus an IR WR. Both teams are 0-8 and need immediate production; an IR WR is useless to B. The rationale is A-centric and shallow, with no mention of B\u2019s incentives or constraints. Mechanically feasible but strategically misaligned.",
