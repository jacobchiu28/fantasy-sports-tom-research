  "justification": "B needs immediate floor and already has multiple pocket QBs; Hall adds little. Asking B to trade a healthy, low-volatility RB (King) and ascending WR2 (Austin Torres) for a bench QB and an OUT WR is misaligned. Calling Harris \u201cstable\u201d contradicts his injury. Torres isn\u2019t a possession WR. The rationale ignores B\u2019s priorities (volume, floor) and overstates accept probability.",
