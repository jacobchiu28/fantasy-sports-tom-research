  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s desire for stability but mislabels Trevor Martin as stable and ignores B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and expert rankings. Asking B to give up Tier 2 Michael Foster for Tier 4 Martin conflicts with B\u2019s consensus-driven approach. Only Campbell fits B\u2019s floor need. Trade is also contextually shaky as B already rosters Trevor Martin. Rationale is brief and generic, with an overly optimistic acceptance probability.",
