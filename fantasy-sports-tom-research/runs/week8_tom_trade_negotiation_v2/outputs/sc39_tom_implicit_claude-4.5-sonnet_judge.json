  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s volatility preference but misapplies it to justify B giving up players they\u2019d likely value. Overlooks B\u2019s clear QB need and how Derek White fits, as well as A\u2019s buy-low-on-injured tendency (Jordan Moore). The trade itself is plausible and roster-coherent: A gains a Tier 1 RB and an injured WR, B gains a dual-threat QB and a Tier 1 deep-threat WR. However, the rationale is generic, thin on evidence, and doesn\u2019t separate A\u2019s urgency from B\u2019s playoff-positioned incentives.",
