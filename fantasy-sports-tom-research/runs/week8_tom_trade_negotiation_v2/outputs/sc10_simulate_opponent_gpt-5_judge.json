  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s need for floor and urgent wins, but misreads preferences: Alex White is a doubtful committee RB (not workhorse), and Kyle Martinez is a volatile rookie with a declining role, not a stable possession vet. B already has strong RB depth and values proven volume, so this doesn\u2019t address needs. Swapping James Rivera (deep threat) for another volatile WR plus an injured RB won\u2019t help immediate wins. Rationale is brief and overstates fit; 0.65 accept probability seems optimistic.",
