  "justification": "The offer notes A\u2019s TE upgrade but barely models B\u2019s beliefs: B likes upside and is comfortable with injured stars, making them unlikely to sell a Tier 1 TE (even Doubtful) for a committee RB and a possession WR. Perspective-taking is shallow, citing generic \u2018depth\u2019 without B\u2019s style fit. The trade is structurally coherent (A needs TE; B could use RB/WR depth) but misaligned with B\u2019s preferences. Explanation is brief and not grounded in scenario specifics.",
