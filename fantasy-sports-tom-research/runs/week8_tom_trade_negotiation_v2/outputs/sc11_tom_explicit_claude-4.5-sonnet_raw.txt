Let me analyze Team B's manager profile and situation:

**Team B's Context:**
- 0-8 record = desperate for immediate wins, not building for future
- Prefers consistency/reliability over variance
- Values workhorse RBs and possession WRs
- Contrarian thinker who buys injured players
- Follows zero-RB but targets high-powered offenses
- Needs players who can produce NOW

**Team B's Roster Gaps:**
- All RBs are committee backs with mid/high volatility - no workhorse
- WR corps is mostly deep-threat/high-variance players
- Lacks the consistent possession receivers they prefer
- Has adequate QB depth with two low-volatility dual-threat/pocket passers

**What Team B Would Value:**
- Low-volatility possession WRs (consistent weekly floors)
- Any upgrade to stable, reliable players
- Players with friendly playoff schedules (still mathematically alive)
- Would NOT value high-variance players or future upside

**Team A's Assets Team B Would Want:**
- Darian Thomas: possession WR, low volatility, veteran, friendly playoff schedule - PERFECT fit
- Ethan Turner: receiving TE, low volatility, veteran, high target share

**What Team A Needs:**
- As a 6-2 team following zero-RB, I need RB depth for playoffs
- Prefer players with friendly playoff schedules
- Can afford to trade away consistent WRs since I have depth

**Fair Trade Construction:**
Team B gets: Darian Thomas (exactly what they need - consistent possession WR)
Team A gets: Josh Flores (RB with friendly playoff schedule, mid volatility acceptable for depth)

This addresses Team B's desperate need for consistency while giving Team A playoff-schedule RB depth.
