  "justification": "Misreads Team B: trading a Tier 1, low-variance QB contradicts their conservative, consensus-driven approach. Labeling Ethan Turner as a TE upgrade is incorrect versus B\u2019s Tier 2 Darian Taylor. The RB pieces (King, L. Torres) are low-tier/declining and don\u2019t deliver the stable floor B seeks, despite the minor injury buy angle. Also conflicts with Team A\u2019s injury-avoidance by targeting Q Cameron Harris. Rationale is brief and inaccurate.",
