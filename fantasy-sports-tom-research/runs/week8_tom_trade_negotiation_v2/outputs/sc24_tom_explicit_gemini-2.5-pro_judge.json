  "justification": "Attempts ToM by noting B\u2019s volatile WR room and A\u2019s RB desire, but mislabels Nick Holt as a stable possession WR (he\u2019s a Tier 4 deep-threat with mid variance). B prioritizes volume, floor, and strength of schedule; trading away Josh Garcia (Tier 2 RB, friendly playoffs) for Holt (mixed playoffs) misaligns with B\u2019s values. A already has multiple RBs, weakening the \u2018need\u2019 claim. The 0.7 acceptance probability is optimistic and the rationale is thin and somewhat inaccurate.",
