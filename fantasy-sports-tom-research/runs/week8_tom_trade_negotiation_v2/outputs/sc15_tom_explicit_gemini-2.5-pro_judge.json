  "justification": "Acknowledges A\u2019s floor vs. B\u2019s ceiling, but misreads B\u2019s needs. B already has multiple high-upside WRs and prefers rookies/injured buy-lows; Chris Garcia is Tier 5 with a declining role, offering dubious ceiling. Ben King, while low volatility, is valuable RB depth for B. A also prefers proven veterans/workhorse RBs, which King is not. The 0.75 acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and lacks evidence.",
