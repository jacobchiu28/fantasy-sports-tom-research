  "justification": "It nods to Team B\u2019s preference for stable floors by offering a pocket QB and low-vol RB, but misses that B already has a pocket QB and prefers possession WRs. The asked WRs aren\u2019t true \u2018consistent\u2019 targets, and the incoming QB is Tier 4 with a declining role. Reasoning doesn\u2019t reference B\u2019s 8-0, playoff-focused incentives or depth needs. The trade is feasible, but the rationale is generic and thin on roster/context specifics.",
