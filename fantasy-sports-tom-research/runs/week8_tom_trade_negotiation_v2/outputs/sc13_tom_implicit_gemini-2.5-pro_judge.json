  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s values: B prefers consistent veterans and possession WRs, yet would trade a Tier 1 RB and a Tier 3 possession WR for a rookie TE (Tier 4) and a Tier 5 WR. Calling Martinez a more stable WR is incorrect versus Hernandez. While it notes A\u2019s RB need and B\u2019s TE weakness, it overstates the TE upgrade and ignores B\u2019s 8-0 risk profile. The deal is lopsided and unlikely, making the 0.7 acceptance probability unrealistic.",
