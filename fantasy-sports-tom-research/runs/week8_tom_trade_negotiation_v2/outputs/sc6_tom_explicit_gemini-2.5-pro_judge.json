  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s 0-8 state and offers a rookie upside RB, but overlooks B\u2019s strong RB depth and stated preference for dual-threat QBs by asking for their only healthy one and replacing him with a pocket QB. The trade itself is feasible and value-positive for B (2-for-1, both healthy), and A\u2019s need is clear, but rationale is thin and lacks concrete, scenario-grounded detail. Acceptance probability seems optimistic.",
