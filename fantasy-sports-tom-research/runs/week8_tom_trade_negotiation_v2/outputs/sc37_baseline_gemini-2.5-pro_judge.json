  "justification": "The proposal only reflects Team A\u2019s needs. Team B is conservative and values workhorse volume and weekly floor; trading Ryan Taylor for an injured committee RB (Mason) and a boom-bust deep threat (Justin) conflicts with their preferences and consensus lean. It ignores B\u2019s TE injury and desire for possession targets. While B has RB depth, the return lacks stability and value, making the offer unrealistic.",
