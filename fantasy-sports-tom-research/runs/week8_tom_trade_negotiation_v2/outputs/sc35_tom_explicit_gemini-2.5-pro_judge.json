  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s need to win now and playoff slate interest, offering a veteran WR plus RB depth, and contrasts A\u2019s consolidation goal. But it glosses over B\u2019s contrarian tilt toward established talent (rookie RB may be undervalued), doesn\u2019t explicitly leverage B\u2019s WR scarcity or RB surplus, and overstates a win-now upgrade versus giving up a steady Tier-2 RB. Coherent but thin rationale.",
