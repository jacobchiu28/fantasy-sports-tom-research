  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s desire for upside/workhorse RB, but ignores B\u2019s dual-threat QB preference and buy-low comfort. Misreads A\u2019s conservative, stability-first profile; the trade sends A a doubtful committee RB and volatile WR. Value/coherence are poor: Tier 1 RB + solid WR for Tier 2 (doubtful) RB + Tier 4 WR. Claim that A gains stability is incorrect. Rationale is generic and lacks injury/role context. p_accept_B is understated; B would likely snap accept.",
