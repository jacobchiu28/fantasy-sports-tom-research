  "justification": "Good ToM: A sends a rookie ceiling WR and volatile RB to entice B\u2019s risk-seeking, breakout-friendly profile, while A seeks a steadier veteran RB. However, it underplays A\u2019s injury caution (Martin Q) and preference for possession WRs (Torres isn\u2019t). Value coherence is mixed: B upgrades WR (Tier 1 to Tier 2 swap favoring B) with similar RB tier. Rationale is brief and lacks specifics (records, stacks, schedules). Overall solid but shallow.",
