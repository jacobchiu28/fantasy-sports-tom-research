  "justification": "It appeals to B\u2019s conservatism (steady RB, pocket QB) but misses B\u2019s reliance on expert rankings and existing pocket QB depth, making a Tier 2 RB-for-Tier 4 downgrade unrealistic. Roles and health align, but value is lopsided toward A and the 0.57 accept rate is optimistic. The rationale is brief and not well-grounded in tiers, roster context, or B\u2019s priorities.",
