  "justification": "Team B is 0-8, prefers reliable floors and possession WRs; trading away Caleb Foster (steady Tier 2 possession WR) for Kyle Taylor (Tier 4, high-variance rookie) conflicts with B\u2019s stated values and urgent need for stability. The pitch frames upside and playoff schedule\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s immediate win-now priority\u2014so acceptance is overestimated. The offer is structurally feasible and suits Team A\u2019s goals, but the rationale is thin and not grounded in B\u2019s motives.",
