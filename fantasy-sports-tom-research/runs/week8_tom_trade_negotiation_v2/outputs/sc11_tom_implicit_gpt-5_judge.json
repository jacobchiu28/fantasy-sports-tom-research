  "justification": "They note B can keep the preferred pocket QB and trade a surplus QB, but misread B\u2019s win-now needs and consistency bias. Offering an \u2018Out\u2019 Tier 5 committee RB and a high-variance WR for a Tier 1 QB is misaligned with B\u2019s priorities (workhorse RBs, reliable targets). Value is lopsided and calling it \u201cRB stability\u201d is inaccurate. Rationale is brief and generic, with little evidence or context.",
