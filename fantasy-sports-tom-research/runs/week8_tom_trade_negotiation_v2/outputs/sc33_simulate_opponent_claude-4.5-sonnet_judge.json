  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s conservative style/pocket-passer preference, but misreads specifics: asks for two Tier-5 outside WRs (not possession/consistent targets) and offers a Tier-4, Questionable pocket QB redundant with B\u2019s healthy pocket QB, plus a low-upside Tier-4 RB. B is 8-0 and trusts consensus, making this low-upside/injury-tinged swap unattractive. Trade is feasible but rationale is generic and overstates fit/acceptance probability.",
