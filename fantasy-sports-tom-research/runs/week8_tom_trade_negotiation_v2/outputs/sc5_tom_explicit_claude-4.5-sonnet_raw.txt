**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B's manager is extremely conservative, preferring stable floors over boom/bust. They're 4-4 and need consistency to make playoffs. However, they're also contrarian and follow zero-RB philosophy, meaning they likely built around WR depth and are comfortable with RB volatility if necessary.

Key observations:
- Team B has Ryan Taylor (workhorse but HIGH volatility with tough playoff matchups) - conflicts with their conservative preference
- Team B lacks true stable floor players at RB despite claiming to want them
- Josh Robinson offers what they claim to want: workhorse role with MID volatility and friendly playoff schedule
- Darian Anderson provides the stable veteran WR with mid variance they prefer
- Team B is deep at WR with multiple deep threats, can afford to trade Devon Moore
- As a contrarian, they might fade Ryan Taylor's workhorse status if volatility concerns them

Team A perspective:
- Gets higher upside in Ryan Taylor (workhorse role aligns with playoff push)
- Devon Moore adds deep-threat upside A prefers
- Trades away mid-volatility pieces for higher ceiling

The trade appeals to B's stated conservative nature while acknowledging their contrarian tendency to move off consensus "workhorse" labels when underlying volatility exists.
