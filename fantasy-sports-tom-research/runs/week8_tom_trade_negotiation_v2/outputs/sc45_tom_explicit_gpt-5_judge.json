  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s consensus lean and playoff focus, but misreads that consensus would not swap an ascending Tier 2 WR (Torres) for a Tier 5 RB (Robinson) plus a lesser WR. B values young ascending WRs and big-play threats; Torres fits that, while Robinson isn\u2019t an obvious ceiling upgrade. The trade undervalues B\u2019s WR and overstates RB appeal. Rationale is brief and not evidence-based. Acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
