  "justification": "Slight nod to B\u2019s possible QB stability need, but it ignores B\u2019s stated preferences (possession WRs, buying injured, OL/SOS) and gives up B\u2019s lone workhorse. Claims A has QB surplus when A would be left without a healthy QB, conflicting with A\u2019s stability ethos. Values and roster impacts are underdeveloped; rationale is generic and A-centric. Coherence is shaky but not impossible.",
