It asks B to give up a Tier 1 RB and a preferred dual-threat QB for a Tier 4 pocket QB, a WR2, and an injured Tier 4 RB\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s urgent need to win and upside preferences. It ignores B\u2019s values (dual-threat QBs, big-play upside) and playoff-slate thinking. It also conflicts with A\u2019s stated preference for pocket passers. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives or constraints.",
