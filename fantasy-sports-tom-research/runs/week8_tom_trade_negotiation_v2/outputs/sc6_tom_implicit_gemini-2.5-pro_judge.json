  "justification": "Offer misreads Team B\u2019s situation. B\u2019s only healthy QB is James Jones; trading him leaves them with an Out QB (Logan Clark), despite needing wins now and valuing dual-threat QBs. While the rookies match B\u2019s upside preference and are healthy, they don\u2019t address B\u2019s immediate need at QB. The claim that B has QB depth is false, and the 0.7 acceptance is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and not grounded in specific roster constraints.",
