  "justification": "No evidence of Team B\u2019s beliefs: they value rookies and upside, yet the rationale ignores this and offers an injured Tier-5 TE as a sweetener. It mislabels Josh Garcia as an RB upgrade over James Holt (Tier 1), and calls Kyle Martinez \u201csteadier\u201d despite variance. Team A\u2019s conservative profile conflicts with adding a rookie deep threat. While B might like upgrading to Holt, sacrificing a rookie RB and WR they value isn\u2019t addressed. Thin, incorrect reasoning and poor ToM.",
