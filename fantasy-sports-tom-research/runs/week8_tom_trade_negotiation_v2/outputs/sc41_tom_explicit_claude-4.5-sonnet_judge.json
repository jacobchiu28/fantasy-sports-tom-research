  "justification": "Rationale misreads Team B\u2019s preferences and assets: it claims B gains consistency, but B would be giving up their consistent TE (Noah Brown) for a volatile WR (Sam Martin) and a mid-tier RB. Little attention to B\u2019s stated love of possession/reliability or to A\u2019s ceiling-chasing motives. The trade is roster-feasible (B has another TE2; A could use a stable TE), but motivations and value alignment are off. Explanation is brief and incorrect.",
