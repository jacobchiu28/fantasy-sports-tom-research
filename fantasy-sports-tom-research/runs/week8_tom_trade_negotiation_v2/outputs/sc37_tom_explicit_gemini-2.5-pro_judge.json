  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s WR volatility and Taylor\u2019s tough playoff slate, but misses key beliefs: B prizes volume/stability, trusts consensus, and prefers possession WRs. Offering Justin Reed (boom-bust, declining role) plus Mason Robinson (injured, committee) for a Tier 1 workhorse misaligns with B\u2019s risk-averse style despite RB surplus. Structure is feasible, but value/fit are off. Rationale is brief and somewhat misleading; acceptance probability is overstated.",
