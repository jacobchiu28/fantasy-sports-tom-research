  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s WR surplus and urgent need for reliable production, but misreads their preferences. Calling Ethan Turner an \u201cTE1 upgrade\u201d is inaccurate (Tier 4 vs B\u2019s Tier 3/4 options), and Sean Adams is Out and not a steady RB or workhorse. Asking for B\u2019s consistent possession WR (Caleb Foster, Tier 2) conflicts with B\u2019s needs for immediate, stable starters. Rationale is brief and not evidence-based.",
