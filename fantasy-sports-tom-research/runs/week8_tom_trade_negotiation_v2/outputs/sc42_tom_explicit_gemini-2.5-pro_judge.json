  "justification": "Understands B values consistency and offers a veteran WR with low variance, while A seeks a TE upgrade. However, it ignores B\u2019s explicit SoS focus and doesn\u2019t mention B\u2019s TE depth. It also conflicts with A\u2019s injury-averse stance by targeting a Questionable TE. The logic of needs/roster fit is plausible, but the rationale is thin and lacks detail on tiers, roles, and playoff schedules. Balanced but shallow ToM.",
