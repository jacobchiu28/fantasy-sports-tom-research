  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s TE weakness and preference for committee RBs/dual-threat QBs, but wrongly assumes QB surplus despite Clark being out. Offers an injured RB (Taylor, Q) to a manager who avoids injuries, undercutting fit. B needs immediate starters and would be left without a healthy QB. Rationale is concise but includes inaccuracies (\u201cwithout injury risk,\u201d TE1 claim) and overlooks B\u2019s risk tolerance and urgent need at QB.",
