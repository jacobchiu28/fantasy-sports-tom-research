  "justification": "Good read on Team B: values dual-threat QBs, friendly playoff schedule, and can spare a depth RB. However, it doesn\u2019t note B\u2019s lack of a viable QB explicitly or their injury aversion (though both players are healthy). Perspective-taking is weak: little discussion of Team A\u2019s needs, surplus QBs, or urgency. Trade is coherent and likely accepted by B, but the explanation is brief and misses nuanced factors like B\u2019s consensus-trusting mindset. Overall: solid but shallow ToM.",
