  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s schedule focus and comfort with injured players, but misreads that B would trade a Tier 2 rookie (Martinez) they likely value highly for an injured Tier 3 WR (Garcia). Misstates playoff schedules (Ben King tough; Martinez mixed), yet claims A receives friendly schedules. Team A\u2019s preferences (possession WRs, workhorse RBs, low variance) don\u2019t align well with Martinez\u2019s high variance or King\u2019s committee role. Value is lopsided toward A; 0.62 accept probability is unrealistic. Reasoning is present but applied inaccurately.",
