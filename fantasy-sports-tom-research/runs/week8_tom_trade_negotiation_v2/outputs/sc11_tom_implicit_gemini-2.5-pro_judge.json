  "justification": "Acknowledges B needs wins but misreads priorities: B prefers consistent workhorse RBs and already has big-play WRs. Offering an injured Tier 5 RB as a \u201cfloor upgrade\u201d is inaccurate, and swapping B\u2019s solid RB/possession WR for a boom-bust WR undermines B\u2019s needs. Rationale is generic and incorrect, making acceptance unlikely and the proposal internally inconsistent with B\u2019s context.",
