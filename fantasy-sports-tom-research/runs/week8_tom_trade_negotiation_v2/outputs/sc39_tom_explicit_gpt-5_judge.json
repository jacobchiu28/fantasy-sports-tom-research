  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s contrarian lean, love for deep-threat WRs, and TE depth, but misreads RB depth (B has a Tier 1 RB plus two Tier 3s). Little attention to A\u2019s urgency or B\u2019s injury tolerance. Asking B to give up its only Tier 1 RB for an injured Tier 5 RB, a TE downgrade, and a WR upgrade is misaligned with B\u2019s playoff posture. Rationale is terse and light on specifics.",
