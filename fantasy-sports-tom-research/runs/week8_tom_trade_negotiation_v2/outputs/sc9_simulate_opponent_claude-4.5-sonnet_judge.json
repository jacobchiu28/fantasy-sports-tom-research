  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s desire for floor/health and a pocket QB, but overlooks B\u2019s zero-RB philosophy, urgent need for wins now, and existing QB depth. Trading B\u2019s top workhorse RB for a committee RB plus a Tier 4 QB misaligns with B\u2019s conservative, floor-first approach. Value is lopsided; 0.72 acceptance is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and thin on roster/tier context and playoff vs. immediate needs.",
