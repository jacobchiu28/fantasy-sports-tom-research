  "justification": "The offer ignores Team B\u2019s preferences and incentives. B values dual\u2011threat QBs and rookies; Devon Green is a pocket passer, and Eric Torres is a veteran. Asking B to give up their RB1 (Jake Garcia) and TE1 (Cameron Gonzalez) guts B\u2019s core while returning no TE and weakening RB depth, despite B being a contender. The rationale is A\u2011centric and generic, only noting A\u2019s stability needs. While A\u2019s internal logic (move surplus QB, stabilize TE/RB) is coherent, the proposal is unrealistic for B and lacks ToM reasoning.",
