```json
{
  "offer_from_A": ["Justin Miller", "Austin Young"],
  "ask_from_B": ["Ryan Taylor", "Malik Carter"],
  "rationale": "Team B needs stable RBs; gets volatile WRs. Team A gets workhorse+floor RB for boom/bust WRs they can replace.",
  "p_accept_B": 0.15
}
```

Wait, let me reconsider Team B's perspective more carefully:

Team B Manager is:
- Struggling at 1-7, needs wins NOW
- Extremely conservative, prefers stable floors
- Follows "zero RB" philosophy (doesn't prioritize RBs)
- Cautious about injuries
- Values possession receivers with consistent targets
- Believes in playoff schedule advantages

Team B has deep RB depth (7 RBs) but volatile/boom-bust WRs. They need consistent scoring NOW to salvage their season. They would NOT want more volatile deep-threat WRs when they're desperate for floor.

Team A has stable RBs Team B might want, but Team A is 7-1 and unlikely to trade their best pieces. However, Team A could offer Sam Lewis (low volatility, friendly playoff schedule RB) which fits Team B's conservative style.

Let me reconstruct:

```json
{
  "offer_from_A": ["Sam Lewis", "Mason Torres"],
  "ask_from_B": ["Ryan Taylor", "Ryan Moore"],
  "rationale": "B gets stable RB+WR for desperate wins. A gets workhorse+upside WR matching risk profile.",
  "p_accept_B": 0.35
}
```
