  "justification": "The proposal misreads Team B: they value dual-threat QBs yet would be giving up their only healthy one (James Jones) for a Tier 4 pocket passer. It even mislabels B\u2019s outgoing QB as a pocket passer. Little evidence of B\u2019s urgency, injury aversion, or roster needs (Logan Clark is out; TE room hurt). The trade is mechanically feasible, but the rationale is generic and inaccurate, and p_accept seems optimistic given B\u2019s preferences. Limited ToM shown.",
