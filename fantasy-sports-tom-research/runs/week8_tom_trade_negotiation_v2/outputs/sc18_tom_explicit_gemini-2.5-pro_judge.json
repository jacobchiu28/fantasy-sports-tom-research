  "justification": "Proposal ignores B\u2019s conservative, possession-WR preference and injury-buy-low tendency. It mislabels Josh Robinson (Tier 5) as a \u201cstud\u201d and calls Brandon Hernandez/Ben King \u201cconsistent\u201d despite deep-threat volatility and a declining RB role with tough playoff matchups. While the swap could fit B\u2019s WR need, the rationale lacks specifics on schedule, roles, or rankings B trusts. Feasible but weak ToM and thin justification.",
