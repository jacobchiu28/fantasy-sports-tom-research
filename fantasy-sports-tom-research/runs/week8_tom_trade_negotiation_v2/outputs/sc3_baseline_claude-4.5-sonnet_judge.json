  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and generic, with no explicit modeling of B\u2019s consensus-driven, rookie/upside, and playoff-SOS priorities or comfort with injuries. The offer also clashes with A\u2019s stated injury aversion by targeting a doubtful TE. Still, the trade is mechanically feasible: A marginally upgrades RB stability (Ben King) and adds TE depth, while B gets a rookie WR with a friendly playoff schedule. However, swapping a Tier 3 RB for a Tier 4 RB is a likely downgrade for B, and the explanation lacks roster- or context-specific evidence.",
