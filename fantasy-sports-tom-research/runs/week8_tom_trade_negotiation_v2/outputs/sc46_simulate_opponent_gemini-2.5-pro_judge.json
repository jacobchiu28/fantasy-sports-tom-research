However, it ignores A\u2019s strict injury-avoidance by asking for an Out QB (David Young) and mislabels him as a stabilizing piece. A already has a stable Tier 2 QB, so depth/consistency worsen. Rationale is generic, omits B\u2019s RB depth and QB context, and likely overestimates acceptance odds.",
