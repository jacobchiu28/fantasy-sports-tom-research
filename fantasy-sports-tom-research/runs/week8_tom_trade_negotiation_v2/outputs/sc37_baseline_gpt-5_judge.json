  "justification": "Neglects Team B\u2019s conservative, volume-first mindset. It asks them to give up Ryan Taylor, a Tier 1 workhorse they highly value, for two boom-bust deep-threat WRs and a doubtful committee RB\u2014poor fit for their floor preference and consensus rankings. Requesting Lucas Carter to \u201cadd a dual-threat QB\u201d ignores that he\u2019s Out, offering no short-term value. The rationale focuses on A\u2019s surplus/needs, not B\u2019s incentives or roster gaps. Structurally feasible but contextually implausible and weakly reasoned.",
