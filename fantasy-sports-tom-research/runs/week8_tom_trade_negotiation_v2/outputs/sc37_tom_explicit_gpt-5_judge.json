  "justification": "Identifies B as QB-rich and seeking floor/depth, but misreads B\u2019s strict preference for workhorse RBs and possession WRs; the offered pieces are volatile committees and a boom/bust WR. Separates A\u2019s playoff/injury-buy logic from B\u2019s needs, but shallowly. Trade is feasible and A\u2019s interest in an injured dual-threat with good playoff slate is coherent, yet A overpays and still lacks a current starting QB. Rationale is terse and omits key context (B\u2019s consensus-driven mindset, Lucas Carter\u2019s uncertainty, A\u2019s QB void).",
