  "justification": "Offer aligns with B\u2019s urgent need for healthy starters (Johnson + Campbell) and cautious injury stance, while A upgrades to a steadier RB and can stash an out WR given a 7-1 record. However, the rationale barely engages B\u2019s contrarian/established-talent bias and misstates A\u2019s return (\u201cascending youth with targets\u201d despite Ben Miller being out). Trade is feasible and roster-coherent, but the ToM reasoning is only moderately explicit and the explanation is thin and partly inaccurate.",
