  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s conservative preference for workhorse RBs and frames Trevor as a boom/bust WR, but ignores that B trusts consensus rankings\u2014giving up a Tier 1 WR plus a depth RB for a Tier 5 RB is unrealistic. The offer is A-skewed despite nods to B\u2019s mindset. Minimal rationale and no detail on roles, tiers, or schedule context. B still needs wins and would demand more or a safer, higher-ranked RB to part with Trevor.",
