  "justification": "It notes Team B\u2019s preference for deep-threat WRs but ignores B\u2019s contrarian style, dual-threat QB interest, and the RB depth hit from losing their only RB1. The offer is positionally and health-wise coherent (WR1 for RB1) and fits Team A\u2019s urgency, but it under-models B\u2019s incentives and roster balance. Rationale is very brief and light on evidence.",
