It ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven, conservative mindset and preference for pocket passers (James Jones is dual-threat) and urgent need for immediate, high-floor production. Acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives, roster needs, or risk profile.",
