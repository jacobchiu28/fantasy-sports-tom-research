  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-first preferences and need for stable targets/touches. It asks B to give up a steady, high-target TE (Noah Brown) for two volatile committee RBs, misaligned with B\u2019s risk profile. Rationale centers only on Team A\u2019s playoff push and \u2018consolidation,\u2019 despite A already rostering a Tier 2 TE. The offer is feasible roster-wise but poorly targeted to B. Low p_accept is reasonable but not justified.",
