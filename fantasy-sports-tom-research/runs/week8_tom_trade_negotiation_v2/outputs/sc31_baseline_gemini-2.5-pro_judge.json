  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s beliefs and incentives. B, who trusts rankings, is unlikely to swap a Tier 1 WR (Rivera) for a doubtful committee RB (Alex White) plus a Tier 4 TE, especially with a Tier 1 TE already rostered. Rationale centers on A\u2019s consolidation, not B\u2019s needs. p_accept_B=0.65 is unrealistic, though B\u2019s RB need offers slight coherence.",
