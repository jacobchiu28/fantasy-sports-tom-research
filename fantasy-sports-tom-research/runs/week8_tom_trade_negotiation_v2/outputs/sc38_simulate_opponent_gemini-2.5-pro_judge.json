  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s desire for a dual-threat QB and playoff push, but ignores B\u2019s injury aversion and the RB depth hit from losing a steady Tier 2 (Harris) while relying on a Questionable RB. Separates A\u2019s desperation and QB depth from B\u2019s needs, but shallowly. Trade is plausible and roster-coherent, yet the rationale is generic and omits schedule/role details. The 0.85 acceptance probability is overstated given B\u2019s safer-floor tendencies and consensus-driven approach.",
