  "justification": "Shows awareness of B\u2019s style and preferences but misreads B\u2019s needs: Team B already has multiple viable RBs (Tier 1/2 committees), so RB scarcity is overstated. Emphasizing playoff schedule for a 4-4 team needing immediate points is misaligned. Calling Trevor Martin a \u2018more stable\u2019 WR conflicts with his deep-threat variance. Trade is feasible but value framing and acceptance probability seem optimistic given Robinson\u2019s Tier 5 status.",
