  "justification": "Correctly spots Team B\u2019s TE hole and pitches a high-upside rookie WR, aligning somewhat with B\u2019s rookie/upside taste. However, it ignores B\u2019s likely reluctance to part with an ascending rookie RB and their consensus-driven mindset. The trade is feasible and role-coherent, and A deals from TE surplus, but the rationale is brief and lacks depth on B\u2019s RB depth, playoff outlook, or rankings context.",
