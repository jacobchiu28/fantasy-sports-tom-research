  "justification": "It nods to Team B\u2019s desire for consistency via a low-variance QB, but overlooks B\u2019s core preference for workhorse RBs and injury caution. Ryan Taylor (workhorse, volatile) is B\u2019s archetype; offering an injured, deep-threat WR mislabeled as a steady WR2 clashes with B\u2019s possession/consistency bias. B already has a Tier 1 QB, so Nelson is a marginal upgrade. Little separation of A\u2019s vs. B\u2019s incentives. The rationale is sparse and partially inaccurate, making the proposal unlikely to appeal to B.",
