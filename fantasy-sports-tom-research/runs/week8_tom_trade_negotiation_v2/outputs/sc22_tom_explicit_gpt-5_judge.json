  "justification": "Recognizes B's preference for consistency and RB depth, offering a 'steady' RB and possession WR while labeling Sean Thompson as volatile. However, it ignores B\u2019s reliance on expert rankings and consolidation needs as an 8-0 team; trading a Tier 1 WR for a committee RB (Tier 3) and a Tier 5 WR is unlikely. No leverage on B\u2019s injury-buying tendency. Rationale is brief and lacks tier/matchup detail.",
