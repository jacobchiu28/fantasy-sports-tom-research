  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s urgency but ignores B\u2019s preference for reliable workhorse RBs and established talent. Trading Sam Lewis (stable Tier 2 RB) weakens B\u2019s thin RB room, while Moore (Tier 3, declining role) and Wright (Tier 5 deep threat) don\u2019t fit B\u2019s consistency bias and WR depth. The rationale is generic and overstates value (\u201ctwo solid starters\u201d), with little two-sided reasoning. Feasible but poorly aligned with B\u2019s beliefs and needs.",
