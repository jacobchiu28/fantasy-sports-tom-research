  "justification": "Good ToM on B\u2019s conservative, floor-first mindset, trust in consensus, and QB redundancy; notes B\u2019s WR weakness and hesitation. Clear separation of A\u2019s urgent WR need from B\u2019s playoff priorities. However, it mislabels Darian Anderson and Brandon Martinez as \u201cstable\u201d (they\u2019re Tier 5 outside WRs with mid variance) and overstates B\u2019s WR depth. The trade is feasible but not aligned with B\u2019s needs; Caleb Garcia is a lateral, declining-role QB. Reasoning is mostly clear, with some inaccuracies.",
