  "justification": "It vaguely targets B\u2019s desire for stability and a possession WR but mislabels Nick Torres (more deep-threat) and ignores B\u2019s zero-RB mindset and urgent win-now needs. It minimally distinguishes A\u2019s consolidation goal from B\u2019s floor/depth aims. The 3-for-1 is feasible and could add depth for B, but QB need is questionable given B\u2019s roster. Rationale is generic and not grounded in roster/SSO details.",
