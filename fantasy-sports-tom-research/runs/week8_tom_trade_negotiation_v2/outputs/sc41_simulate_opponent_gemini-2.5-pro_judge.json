  "justification": "Identifies Team B\u2019s need to win now but mislabels Lucas Allen as a reliable starter and ignores B\u2019s preference for consistency and veterans. Fails to note B\u2019s TE depth (making Brown expendable) or A\u2019s lack of need at TE (already has Tier 2 and possible Tier 1). Trade value is lopsided (Tier 1 RB for Tier 2 TE + injured WR) and rationale is thin and inaccurate, though B might accept due to RB upgrade.",
