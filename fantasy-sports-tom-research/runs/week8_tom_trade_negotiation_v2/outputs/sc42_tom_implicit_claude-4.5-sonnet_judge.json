  "justification": "Identifies B might value a consistent Tier 1 QB, but overlooks B\u2019s QB surplus and preference for possession WRs and strength of schedule. Holt is primarily a deep threat with tough playoff matchups; Robinson has a friendly playoff slate and workhorse role B may prize. Offer is value-incoherent (Tier 1 QB + Tier 2 WR for Tier 5 RB) and leaves A thin at QB. Rationale is brief and overstates Holt as possession depth.",
