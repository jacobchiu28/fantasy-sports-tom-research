  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking mindset and Week 10 QB bye need, but misreads core values. B trusts consensus and prioritizes RB workloads; trading a Tier 2 RB (Flores) for a Tier 5 QB (Roberts) and Tier 5 WR (Taylor) is unlikely. Flores isn\u2019t expendable given B\u2019s RB room and Alex White\u2019s doubtfulness. Offer is feasible roster-wise but value is off, and acceptance probability is overstated. Rationale is brief and lacks evidence about B\u2019s RB priorities and player tiers.",
