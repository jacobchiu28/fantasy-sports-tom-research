  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s QB surplus and offers a \u2018workhorse\u2019 RB plus a veteran slot WR that could appeal. But it overlooks B\u2019s floor-first mindset (both incoming pieces carry variance) and that B already has strong RBs. The claim A \u201cupgrades TE\u201d is incorrect (A has a Tier 1 TE; Justin Wright is Out/Tier 5). A\u2019s stated preference for dual-threat QBs also conflicts with targeting Tyler Miller. Rationale is concise but superficial.",
