  "justification": "Proposal is A-centric and mislabels Xavier Carter (A\u2019s Tier 1 RB) as depth. Minimal evidence the model understood B\u2019s contrarian mindset or preferences (deep-threat WRs, dual-threat QBs). While B does have surplus TEs and could use an RB upgrade, this is not articulated. Trade undermines A\u2019s urgent win-now needs by downgrading RB to upgrade TE. Explanation is generic, lacks roster- and role-specific justification.",
