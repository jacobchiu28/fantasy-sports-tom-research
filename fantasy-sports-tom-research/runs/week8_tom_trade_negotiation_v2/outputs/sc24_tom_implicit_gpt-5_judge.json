  "justification": "It misreads Team A\u2019s injury-averse, floor-seeking profile by asking them to take a Doubtful TE and a high-variance QB while giving up their safer, ascending QB. For Team B, it acknowledges QB stability and SoS but ignores B\u2019s strict injury avoidance by sending them a Questionable TE and overlooks their existing QB stability (Austin Reed). The rationale is brief and generic; \u201cA upgrades TE floor\u201d is inaccurate given Anderson\u2019s injury. Overall fit and value logic are shaky.",
