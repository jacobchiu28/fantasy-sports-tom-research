  "justification": "Acknowledges A\u2019s QB surplus and B\u2019s taste for dual-threat QBs, but overstates B\u2019s QB urgency despite B having Logan Holt (Tier 2). Ignores B\u2019s stronger needs (TE upgrade, RB depth) and stacking preference. Trade is feasible, yet swaps B\u2019s Tier 2 WR for a lateral QB upgrade with minor injury risk. Rationale is brief and not grounded in roster specifics, making the 0.72 accept estimate optimistic.",
