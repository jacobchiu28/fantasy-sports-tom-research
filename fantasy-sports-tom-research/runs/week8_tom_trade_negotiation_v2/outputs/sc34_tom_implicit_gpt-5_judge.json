Minimal separation of A vs. B motives beyond a one-line note. The trade is contextually weak: B prefers young ascending players (Marcus Reed) and wouldn\u2019t downgrade that sharply. Rationale is brief and generic, with misplaced emphasis on playoff schedule for a 0-8 team. Acceptance probability is overstated.",
