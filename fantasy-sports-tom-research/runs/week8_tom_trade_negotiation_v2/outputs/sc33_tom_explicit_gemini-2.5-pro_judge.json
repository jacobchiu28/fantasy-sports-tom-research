  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s conservatism and pitches a low-volatility RB, but ignores B\u2019s stated preference for possession WRs/pocket passers and reliance on expert rankings. Little attention to B\u2019s roster context (RB depth strong, WR depth thin), and no discussion of A\u2019s needs. Trey Adams\u2019 declining role undercuts the \u2018safe floor\u2019 claim. The trade is feasible (Tier 4 RB for Tier 5 WR) but the rationale is generic and not well-grounded in the scenario.",
