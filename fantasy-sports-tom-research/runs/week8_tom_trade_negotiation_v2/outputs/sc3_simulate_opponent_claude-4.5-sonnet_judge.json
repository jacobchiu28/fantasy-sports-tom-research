  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s taste for dual-threat QBs, but misses key beliefs: B trusts consensus (downgrading from Tier 1 Harris to Tier 2 Hernandez is unlikely), prefers rookies (Trey Adams isn\u2019t a rookie), and is fine buying injured rather than selling one. For A, acquiring a Questionable QB conflicts with their strict injury avoidance. RB swap is a downgrade for B (Ben King T3 to Trey Adams T4). Rationale is generic and overlooks playoff-SOS details. p_accept is overstated.",
