  "justification": "Understands B\u2019s win-now needs and that Clark (Out) is expendable alongside Jones; a TE1 plus ascending RB fits B\u2019s TE weakness and injury aversion. Takes B\u2019s perspective by framing Jones as the starter. But the rationale is very brief and calls Clark a \u201cbackup,\u201d downplaying his Tier 1 value and B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs. Some coherence issues for A (giving up TE2 with Walker doubtful and acquiring an injured QB despite needing wins).",
