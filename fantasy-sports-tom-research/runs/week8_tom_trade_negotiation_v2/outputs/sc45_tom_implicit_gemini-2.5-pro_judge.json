  "justification": "Correctly targets B\u2019s WR surplus and RB need and notes playoff schedule, but ignores B\u2019s injury caution (both Isaiah and Austin Q) and preference for consensus/stack fits. A\u2019s injury-averse profile clashes with acquiring a Q-tag WR, and calling Isaiah a \u201cstable WR1\u201d is overstated. Value is lopsided (A sends a Tier 1 RB plus a fringe WR for a Tier 2 WR). Rationale is concise but thin on roster/context specifics.",
