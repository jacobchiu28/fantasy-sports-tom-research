  "justification": "Superficial ToM: it notes B needs starters but ignores B\u2019s stated preference for possession WRs by asking for their only low-variance slot option. It also overlooks A\u2019s injury aversion by targeting a Questionable player. The deal guts A\u2019s RB depth by sending a Tier 1 RB for a Tier 3 WR, making the \u2018consolidation\u2019 claim illogical. Rationale is generic and not grounded in roles, tiers, or roster needs.",
