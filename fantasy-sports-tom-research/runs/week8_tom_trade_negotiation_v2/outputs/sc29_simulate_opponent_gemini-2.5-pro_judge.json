  "justification": "Shallow read of Team B: ignores their tendency to buy injured players and preference for deep threats/committee backs. Claims B \u201csells high\u201d on a Tier 5 RB is off. For Team A, injury-averse yet taking on a Doubtful TE, and giving up a Tier 1 RB for a Tier 5 \u201cworkhorse\u201d is inconsistent and poor value. The rationale is generic and mislabels the upgrade. Overall lacks coherent roster fit, health context, and specific motivation alignment.",
