  "justification": "Rationale only addresses Team A\u2019s needs and ignores Team B\u2019s preferences (consistency, possession WRs) and urgent-win context. B already has multiple deep-threat WRs and values reliability; swapping a steady Tier 2 receiving TE for a volatile deep-threat WR plus a Tier 3 RB conflicts with that. Trade is feasible but misaligned with both profiles, and A already has a healthy Tier 2 TE. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
