  "justification": "Good acknowledgment of Team B\u2019s conservative style and reluctance to give up their most stable RB, plus noting B\u2019s willingness to hold injured players. However, it mislabels Trevor Martin as a stable WR and overstates B being \u2018thin\u2019 at RB. The trade is value-coherent (B upgrades WR significantly) but clashes with B\u2019s floor-first philosophy. Reasoning is balanced but contains factual slips and minor role mismatches.",
