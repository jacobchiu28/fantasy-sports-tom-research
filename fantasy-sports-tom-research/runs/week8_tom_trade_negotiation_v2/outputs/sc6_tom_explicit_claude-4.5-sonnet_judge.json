  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s appetite for upside and rookie WRs and offers a TE upgrade, but misreads B\u2019s QB situation by implying a viable dual-threat backup (Logan Clark is out) and ignores B\u2019s strong preference for dual-threat QBs. Reasoning is thin and omits B\u2019s urgent 0-8 context and TE need specifics. The trade itself is plausible and addresses B\u2019s TE weakness while backfilling QB with Flores, but style/fit concerns remain. Explanation lacks depth.",
