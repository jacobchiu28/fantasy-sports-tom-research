  "justification": "The offer fits A\u2019s risk profile and gives B a clear TE upgrade, but the rationale poorly models B: it ignores B\u2019s strong injury aversion (making trading away an Out QB attractive) and their urgent need for healthy contributors. Calling Logan Clark a \u201cbackup\u201d is misleading. The explanation lacks detail on B\u2019s TE weakness, roster context, and consensus-driven valuations. The trade itself is coherent, but the acceptance probability seems overstated and insufficiently justified.",
