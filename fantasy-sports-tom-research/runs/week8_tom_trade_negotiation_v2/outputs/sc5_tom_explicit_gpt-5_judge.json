  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s desire for floor but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB bent, veteran bias, and that B already has two Tier 1 RBs. Calls Allen a surplus boom WR and Flores a spare TE without addressing B\u2019s TE depth risk. Value is lopsided (T5 RB for T2 WR + T3 TE), making the 0.58 accept rate optimistic. Brief rationale shows both sides but lacks roster- and bye-specific evidence.",
