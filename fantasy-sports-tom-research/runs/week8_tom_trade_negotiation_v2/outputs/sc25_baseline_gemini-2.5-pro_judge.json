  "justification": "Minimal ToM: it assumes B wants an RB anchor but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB approach and strong preference for breakout rookies like Cameron Scott. It misreads A\u2019s roster\u2014A already has a Tier 1 TE (Adam Wilson), so claiming a TE weakness is incoherent, especially when asking for a Tier 4 TE. The value framing is shallow and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives or playoff posture. Rationale is generic and not grounded in roster context.",
