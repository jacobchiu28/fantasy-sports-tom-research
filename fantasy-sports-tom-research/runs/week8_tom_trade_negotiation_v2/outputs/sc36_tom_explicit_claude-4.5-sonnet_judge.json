  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: claims B needs RB depth while asking for their Tier 1 workhorse, reducing depth. Ignores B\u2019s urgent need for immediate wins and reliance on expert consensus, making an injured QB (Out) and a doubtful WR poor near-term returns. Minimal, generic rationale with incorrect premise; no balancing of A vs B incentives. Offer is unrealistic and internally inconsistent.",
