  "offer_from_A": ["Darian Anderson", "Liam Green"],
  "ask_from_B": ["Ben King", "Cameron Scott"],
  "rationale": "Team B gets young breakout RB + mid-variance WR; Team A gets stable floor RB + low-variance possession WR",
  "p_accept_B": 0.62
}
```

**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B's manager is an aggressive risk-taker (6-2 record) who chases ceiling over floor and values rookies with breakout potential. They actively buy low on injured players and make independent evaluations.

What Team B likely wants:
- Young players with upside (Liam Green is a young breakout RB)
- Players with boom potential to maximize ceiling
- Not concerned about volatility or floor

How Team B perceives fairness:
- Values upside over consistency
- Willing to give up stable players (Ben King - low volatility, Cameron Scott - low variance rookie) for higher-ceiling options
- Sees Liam Green as a young breakout RB with growth potential
- Darian Anderson provides mid-variance veteran depth at WR

Why this works for Team A:
- Desperately needs wins (1-7) with conservative approach
- Ben King offers low volatility RB production (stable floor)
- Cameron Scott is low-variance possession-style WR (outside receiver, rookie with friendly playoff schedule)
- Both align with Team A's preference for stable weekly floors over boom/bust

The trade addresses Team A's need for consistency while giving Team B the young breakout upside they prefer.
