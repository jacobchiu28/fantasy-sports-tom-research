  "justification": "Proposal centers on Team A\u2019s gains and ignores Team B\u2019s stated preferences (volume, friendly schedule, injury avoidance). Asking for an injured TE (Anderson) contradicts Team A\u2019s injury-cautious profile. B would likely resist swapping Josh Garcia\u2019s friendly playoff schedule for Jordan Foster\u2019s tough slate and declining role. Rationale is brief and not tailored to B\u2019s mindset.",
