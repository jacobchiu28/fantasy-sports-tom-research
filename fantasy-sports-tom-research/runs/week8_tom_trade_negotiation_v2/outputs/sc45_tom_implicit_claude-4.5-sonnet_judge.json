  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s RB depth need and playoff-schedule awareness, but ignores B\u2019s strong preference for high-tier, young deep-threat WRs and adherence to consensus. Asking for two Tier 2 WRs for a Tier 5 RB and Tier 3 WR is lopsided. A\u2019s injury-cautious profile conflicts with targeting a Questionable WR. The rationale is vague and inaccurate (\u201cswapping deep threats\u201d when Isaiah isn\u2019t one). Acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
