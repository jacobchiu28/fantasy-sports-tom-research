  "justification": "Proposal mostly ignores Team B\u2019s mindset. Robinson offers workload and a friendly playoff schedule\u2014exactly what B values in consistency and SOS\u2014while the incoming pieces (Marcus Reed high-volatility, Trevor Martin deep-threat) misalign with B\u2019s preferences. Labeling Robinson an \u201cupgrade\u201d over a Tier 1 RB is inconsistent with the tiers and A\u2019s ceiling-chasing style. Rationale is thin and one-sided, with little evidence about B\u2019s needs or rankings. The offer is feasible but poorly targeted.",
