  "justification": "Misreads Team B as TE-rich; their top TEs are Out/Doubtful, so trading Tyler Anderson weakens a conservative manager\u2019s floor. Team B prefers possession receivers; Brandon Hernandez is a high-variance deep threat. Team A avoids injuries and already has a healthy Tier 1 TE, making an injured TE a poor target. Austin Martin adds little RB value. Rationale is brief and inaccurate.",
