  "justification": "The proposal addresses Team A\u2019s TE need but barely considers Team B\u2019s mindset. B is conservative, follows consensus, values stability and TE depth, and already has ample WRs. Swapping their TE3 (with a friendly playoff slate) for A\u2019s volatile Tier 5 WR is unlikely to match B\u2019s preferences. The offer is feasible but undervalues TE scarcity for B. Rationale is brief and one-sided, offering little evidence of B\u2019s incentives or needs.",
