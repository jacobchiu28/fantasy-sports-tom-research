  "justification": "Shows some awareness that B wants consistency (steady QB, tough playoff RB) but ignores that B values workhorse RBs and already has a Tier 1 QB. Calls a TE downgrade an upgrade (B\u2019s TE is Tier 2; A\u2019s is Tier 4). Minimal separation of A vs. B incentives, little roster-context reasoning. Trade is feasible but imbalanced 3-for-1 where B parts with their best asset.",
