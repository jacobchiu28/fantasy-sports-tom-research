  "justification": "Trade favors A\u2019s preferences (upside WR, TE upgrade) but misreads B. B prefers healthy, consistent, consensus-ranked players; instead they\u2019d get a Tier 4 WR and an Out RB, while giving up a Tier 2 WR and a rising TE. The rationale is generic and ignores B\u2019s injury caution and consistency bias. Offer is mechanically feasible but not aligned with B\u2019s incentives, making the stated 0.6 acceptance unlikely.",
