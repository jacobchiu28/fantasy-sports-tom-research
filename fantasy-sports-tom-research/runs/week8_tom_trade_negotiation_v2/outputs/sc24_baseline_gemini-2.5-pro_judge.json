  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile and preference for volume/possession WRs. Asking for a doubtful Tier-1 TE for a volatile Tier-4 deep-threat WR is unrealistic. It also conflicts with Team A\u2019s injury-cautious approach by targeting an injured player. No reasoning about Team B\u2019s incentives, roster depth, or schedule considerations; rationale is generic and one-sided.",
