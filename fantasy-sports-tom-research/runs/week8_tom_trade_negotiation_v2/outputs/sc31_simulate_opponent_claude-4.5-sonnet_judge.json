  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s taste for committee backs/rookies and playoff schedules, but ignores B\u2019s trust in rankings and buy-low-on-injury approach. Asking a 7\u20131 team to trade a Tier 1 RB with a friendly playoff slate for a Tier 4 RB plus a Tier 5 rookie misreads incentives; depth isn\u2019t B\u2019s need. Offer is feasible but highly unrealistic; acceptance probability is inflated. Rationale is brief and omits key context.",
