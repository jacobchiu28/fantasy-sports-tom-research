  "justification": "Identifies Team B\u2019s RB weakness, but overlooks that B values high-upside, established talent\u2014making it unlikely they\u2019d part with a Tier 1 TE (even injured). Mislabels Nick Holt as steadier than Justin Miller. From A\u2019s conservative profile, trading a workhorse RB and Tier 1 WR for an injured TE and a Tier 4 WR is inconsistent and a major overpay. Rationale is brief and not grounded in injury context or team priorities. Acceptance odds seem miscalibrated.",
