  "justification": "Limited ToM: ignores B\u2019s strong QB (Austin Reed), RB-volume priority, and aversion to volatile WRs; asks B to downgrade WR (Cameron to Nick) and sacrifice RB depth for a QB2. Undervalues B\u2019s strength-of-schedule focus (Cameron has tough playoff slate) only partly addressed by Sam\u2019s schedule. From A\u2019s side, trading away a healthy Tier-2 pocket passer conflicts with A\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking profile, leaving a questionable Tier-4 QB. Rationale is brief and mislabels Cameron as a stable possession WR.",
