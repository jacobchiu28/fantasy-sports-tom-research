  "justification": "Good read on B\u2019s WR surplus and appetite for injured, committee-upside RBs; RB depth need is real. However, A overpays (Tier 2 RB + TE4) for a WR4, conflicting with A\u2019s urgent need for immediate high ceiling. Little attention to B\u2019s TE redundancy (has a TE1) or A\u2019s RB injuries. Rationale is concise but thin on specifics.",
