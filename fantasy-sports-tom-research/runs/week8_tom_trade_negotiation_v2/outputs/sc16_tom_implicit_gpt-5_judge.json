  "justification": "Minor ToM attempt by offering a steady pocket QB for B\u2019s consistency bias, but it ignores B\u2019s strong preference for workhorse RBs by asking for Ryan Taylor. The TE piece is a downgrade (B has a Tier 2 TE; A offers Tier 4), contradicting the stated \u201cTE upgrade.\u201d B already has a Tier 1 QB, making Nelson redundant. The valuation and fit are incoherent, and the explanation is brief and factually off.",
