Let me analyze Team B's manager profile and motivations:

**Team B Manager Analysis:**
- Record: 4-4, fighting for playoffs - needs wins NOW
- Playing style: Favors high-upside players with inconsistent production
- Preferences: Committee backs with upside, deep-threat WRs, rookies with breakout potential
- Decision making: Independent evaluator, not slave to consensus
- Injury approach: Willing to buy low

**Team B's Needs:**
- RB depth is entirely committee backs - lacks a workhorse RB for consistent scoring
- Has plenty of high-variance deep-threat WRs but no stable floor
- Needs playoff-friendly schedules given 4-4 record

**Team B's Perception of Fairness:**
- Would value a workhorse RB highly (doesn't have one)
- Would appreciate rookie upside (fits preference)
- Friendly playoff schedule is critical for playoff push
- Would trade away WR depth since they have 6 WRs vs limited RB options

**My Strategy:**
Offer Josh Robinson (workhorse RB, rookie, friendly playoff schedule) - checks ALL of Team B's boxes. In return, ask for Trevor Martin (veteran deep-threat WR with mid variance and mixed playoff outlook). Team A has plenty of WR depth and needs to consolidate for playoffs.

This addresses Team B's critical RB need while giving them the rookie upside and playoff schedule they need. Team A gets a more stable WR option while maintaining RB depth with Josh Martin as workhorse backup.
