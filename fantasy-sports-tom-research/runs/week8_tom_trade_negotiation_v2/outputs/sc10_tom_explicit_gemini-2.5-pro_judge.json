  "justification": "Misses Team B\u2019s stated preferences (veteran, high-volume, stable roles) by offering a volatile young WR and a doubtful committee RB. Calls Marcus Garcia a \u201cstud TE\u201d despite Tier 4/Q tag and ignores that Team A already rosters a Tier 1 TE, making the move illogical. Value is grossly lopsided (A overpays), so B\u2019s accept probability is understated. Rationale is concise but inaccurate and not grounded in roster/context.",
