  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s mindset and needs. B is conservative, prefers pocket passers/veterans, and needs wins; trading a Tier 1 QB (Chris Reed) plus a starter WR for a rookie Tier 5 RB is implausible, especially with B\u2019s RB depth. It mislabels Josh Robinson as \u201celite\u201d and claims A has RB depth despite injuries. Rationale is A-centric, doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives (injured buy-lows, possession WRs), and conflicts with A\u2019s own preference for workhorse RB stability and stacks.",
