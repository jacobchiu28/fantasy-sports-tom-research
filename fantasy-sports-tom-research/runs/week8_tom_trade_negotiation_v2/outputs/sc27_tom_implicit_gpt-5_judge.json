  "justification": "Understands B needs immediate help and offers healthy pieces, but ignores B\u2019s stated preference for workhorse RBs and trust in established talent (giving up a Tier 1 TE). Calling Anderson an upgrade in \u201cstability\u201d conflicts with A\u2019s injury aversion since he\u2019s Doubtful. Return for B is a Tier 4 TE and a mid-variance WR, not aligned with B\u2019s consistency goals. Rationale is brief and generic.",
