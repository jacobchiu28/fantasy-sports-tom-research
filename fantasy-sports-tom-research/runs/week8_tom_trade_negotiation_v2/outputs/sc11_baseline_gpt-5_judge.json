  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and generic, with no reference to B\u2019s urgent need for wins, preference for consistency/workhorse RBs, or TE weakness. Asking B to give a Tier 1 WR for a volatile WR plus an RB lacks alignment with B\u2019s stated values. It also clashes with A\u2019s conservative, possession-WR preference by targeting a high-variance outside WR. The trade is feasible roster-wise but contextually incoherent with manager profiles. Little evidence of ToM reasoning.",
