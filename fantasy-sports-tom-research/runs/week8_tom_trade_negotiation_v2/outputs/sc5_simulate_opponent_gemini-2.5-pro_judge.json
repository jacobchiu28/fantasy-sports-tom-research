  "justification": "They note Team B\u2019s desire for floor and TE depth, but misread player profiles: Trey Mitchell and Darian Anderson aren\u2019t high-floor archetypes for B, and B prefers workhorse RBs/possession WRs. Asking for Justin Wright (Tier 5, Out) as a \u201cstud TE\u201d is incorrect, especially since Team A already has a Tier 1 TE. The trade is feasible but incoherent with A\u2019s aims and B\u2019s preferences. Rationale is brief and factually off.",
