  "justification": "Misreads Team B: labels Brandon Martinez as a stable possession WR, but he\u2019s a Tier 5 outside WR with variance\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s preference for possession targets and floor. Little evidence of B\u2019s consensus-driven, injury-averse mindset or 7\u20131 incentives. Trade is feasible, but A gives up Sean Hernandez (Tier 1, friendly playoffs) for Xavier Rodriguez (Tier 1, declining role, tough playoffs), clashing with A\u2019s conservative priorities. Rationale is generic and lacks context; p_accept_B is overstated for a lateral RB swap plus fringe WR.",
