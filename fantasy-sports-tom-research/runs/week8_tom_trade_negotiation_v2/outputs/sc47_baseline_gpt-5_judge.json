  "justification": "Ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile and preference for pocket passers/possession WRs. Asks them to downgrade from healthy Tier 2 QB (Foster) to Tier 3 (Hall) and take on an injured, high-variance WR (Nelson), which conflicts with their values. The claim to \u201cadd steady WR\u201d is incorrect\u2014A would receive Lucas Allen (out, Tier 5). Only coherent element is A fixing QB bye overlap. Rationale is generic and misaligned with B\u2019s incentives.",
