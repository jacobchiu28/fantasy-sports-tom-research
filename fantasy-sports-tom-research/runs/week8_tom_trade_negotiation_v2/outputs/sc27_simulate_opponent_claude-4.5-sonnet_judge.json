  "justification": "Shallow ToM: it nods to B wanting stability but ignores B\u2019s preference for workhorse RBs, existing Tier-2 QB (no QB need), and that B would be left with no healthy TE. It also misreads A\u2019s injury-cautious profile by targeting a Doubtful TE and calls B\u2019s situation a \u201cplayoff push\u201d at 0-8. The rationale is generic and not roster-specific. Overall, low coherence with team profiles and needs.",
