Offer (injured RB3 Robinson + volatile WR4 Martinez) doesn\u2019t match B\u2019s floor/consistency preference or urgent needs. Minimal nod to B\u2019s SoS focus; rationale is A-centric and generic. Trade is mechanically feasible but contextually unrealistic for B to accept. ToM reasoning is weak and lacks evidence-based justification.",
