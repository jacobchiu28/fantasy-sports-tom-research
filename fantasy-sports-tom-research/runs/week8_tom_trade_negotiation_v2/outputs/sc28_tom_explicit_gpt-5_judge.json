  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they already have a Tier 1 TE, so Noah Brown is a downgrade, and Derek Harris is out and volatile, not a floor play for a conservative, win-now manager. Asking for Austin Torres (healthy, ascending, favorable schedule) contradicts B\u2019s immediate needs. Rationale is brief and relies on generic TE scarcity, ignoring B\u2019s roster context. Minimal separation of A vs. B incentives.",
