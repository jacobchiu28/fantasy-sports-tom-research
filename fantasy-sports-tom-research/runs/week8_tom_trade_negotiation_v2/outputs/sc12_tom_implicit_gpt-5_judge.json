  "justification": "Captures that Team B likes dual-threat upside and Team A wants floor, but ignores B\u2019s strong record, expert-ranking mindset, and the high market value of Jake Garcia. Trade fit is plausible (B upgrades QB; A gets a steady RB and pocket QB), yet value imbalance makes B\u2019s acceptance unlikely. Rationale is very brief and misses specifics (B\u2019s IR Tier 1 QB, RB depth, tiers/roles), limiting ToM depth.",
