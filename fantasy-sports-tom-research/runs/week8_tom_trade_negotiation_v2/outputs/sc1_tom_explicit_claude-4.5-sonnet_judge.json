  "justification": "Team B is conservative and values workhorse RBs, possession WRs, and pocket passers; this offer gives them a second Tier 1 dual-threat QB (redundant with Jake Green) and an outside WR with mid variance, while asking for their stable RB (Ben King). It misunderstands B\u2019s likely priorities. For Team A (0-8), trading away a Tier 1 QB for a Tier 3 RB and a blocking TE offers little immediate win equity. Rationale is generic and mislabels A\u2019s situation as a rebuild.",
