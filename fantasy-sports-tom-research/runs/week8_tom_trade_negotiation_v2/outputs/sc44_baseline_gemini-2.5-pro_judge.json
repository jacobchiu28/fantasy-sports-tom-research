  "justification": "The proposal centers on Team A\u2019s upgrade and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative mindset, urgent need for wins, and avoidance of injury risk. Offering an injured TE (David Flores, Q) and a low-tier committee RB (Austin Wright) for B\u2019s healthy ascending Tier 2 WR (Austin Torres) conflicts with B\u2019s preferences and consensus values. While positionally possible, it\u2019s contextually misaligned and unlikely to be accepted. The rationale is generic and A-centric, with no explanation of why B would see the return as safer or immediately helpful.",
