The move fits B\u2019s WR surplus, yet A overpays for a Tier 4 boom/bust rookie, making A\u2019s side less coherent for ceiling-chasing. Rationale is very brief and lacks specifics (usage trends, injury risk aversion, bye/starter context). Coherent and likely acceptable for B, but ToM depth is limited.",
