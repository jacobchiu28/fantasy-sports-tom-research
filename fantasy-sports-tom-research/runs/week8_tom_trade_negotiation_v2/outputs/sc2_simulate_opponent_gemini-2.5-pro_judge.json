  "justification": "Shallow ToM. It vaguely assumes Team B needs RB help but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB approach, consensus-trusting, and injury caution (though Ryan Taylor is healthy). It misstates that A is upgrading at TE by acquiring a Tier 4 TE, while A already has a Tier 3 TE. The trade is wildly lopsided (Tier 1 RB for Tier 4 TE) and incoherent with A\u2019s risk/ceiling profile. Explanation is generic and not grounded in roster or playoff context.",
