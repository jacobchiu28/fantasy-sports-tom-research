Justin Wright is Tier 5, out, declining role, and tough playoff matchups\u2014contrary to B\u2019s consensus-driven, upside-focused approach. A is conservative and injury-averse yet targets Malik White (questionable, committee, declining role), not a steady workhorse. The rationale is terse and mislabels Wright as a breakout. Offer is unlikely and internally inconsistent.",
