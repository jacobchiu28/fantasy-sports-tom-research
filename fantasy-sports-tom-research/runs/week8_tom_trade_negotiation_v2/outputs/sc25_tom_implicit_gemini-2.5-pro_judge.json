  "justification": "Trade misunderstands Team B\u2019s profile and needs (zero RB, values rookies/dual-threat QBs/injured buys). It labels Nick Holt a WR2 (he\u2019s Tier 4) and claims B \u2018needs\u2019 an RB despite already having multiple. For Team A, calling Ethan Turner (Tier 4 TE, tough playoffs) an \u2018upgrade\u2019 is incorrect\u2014A already rosters a Tier 1 TE and ample TE depth. The offer is lopsided and incoherent for A, with thin, error-prone rationale.",
