  "justification": "Notes Team B\u2019s conservatism but ignores that B already has a Tier 1 QB and values workhorse RBs and stable targets. Offering a Tier 5 QB and a questionable committee RB for B\u2019s Tier 3 RB and Tier 2 WR is lopsided and unlikely for a consensus-trusting manager. Little evidence B would sacrifice WR/RB stability for QB depth. Explanation is generic and miscasts Holt as a pure stability play. Acceptance probability is overstated.",
