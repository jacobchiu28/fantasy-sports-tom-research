  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s urgent need for healthy, low-risk starters and strict injury avoidance. A sends an Out WR (Harris) and a Questionable TE (Flores) to a manager who avoids injuries and already has TE depth, while asking for B\u2019s healthy Tier 1 RB (Kyle) and ascending Tier 2 WR (Austin). Rationale is A-centric (TE surplus, steady RB2) with no appeal to B\u2019s incentives or consensus rankings. Internally feasible but contextually incoherent for B.",
