  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s mindset and needs. B trusts consensus and likely values Jordan Williams (Tier 3, friendly playoff slate) far above Trevor Roberts (Tier 5) and Michael Mitchell (Tier 5). B already has Mason Garcia and James Jones at QB, so Roberts doesn\u2019t solve a need. The bye-week claim is incorrect (Jordan Bye 12, not 11). Rationale is concise but largely A-centric and factually shaky, making the proposal unrealistic for B.",
