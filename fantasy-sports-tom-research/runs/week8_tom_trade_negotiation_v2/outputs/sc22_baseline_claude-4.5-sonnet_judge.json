  "justification": "Proposal centers on Team A\u2019s needs and ignores Team B\u2019s preferences for reliable, workhorse RBs and consistent possession WRs. Team B actively buys injured players, making trading away a Q-tag RB less likely. B already has strong TE depth, so Austin Allen isn\u2019t enticing, and Marcus Taylor (Tier 5, high variance) doesn\u2019t fit B\u2019s consistency bias. Trade is feasible but misaligned and even undercuts A by moving their best TE. Rationale is minimal and not B-focused.",
