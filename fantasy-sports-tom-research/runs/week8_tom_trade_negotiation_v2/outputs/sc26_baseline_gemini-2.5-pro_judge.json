  "justification": "A-centric rationale with little modeling of B\u2019s motives. Ignores B\u2019s preference to buy low on injured players (making them less likely to sell Tyler Anderson) and their dual-threat QB emphasis. Doesn\u2019t mention Anderson\u2019s Doubtful status or B\u2019s TE depth. The trade is plausible (A needs TE, B could use RB help), but paying a Tier 1 RB for an injured TE is risky for A\u2019s conservative style. Minimal, non-evidence-based explanation.",
