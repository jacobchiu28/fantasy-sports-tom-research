  "justification": "Good recognition that Team B values stability and playoff schedules, and that A will assume Taylor\u2019s volatility. However, offering a Tier 2 committee RB plus a Tier 4 WR for a Tier 1 workhorse likely undershoots value. Mason Torres isn\u2019t a possession, high-floor WR B prefers, and B\u2019s 1-7 urgency makes downgrading RB risky. Zero-RB philosophy suggests B would want a stronger WR return. p_accept_B=0.6 seems optimistic.",
