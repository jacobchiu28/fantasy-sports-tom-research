  "justification": "The offer targets B\u2019s TE surplus (Noah Brown) and sends a Tier 1 RB (King) plus a possession WR (Allen), aligning with B\u2019s need for reliable starters and preference for possession profiles. However, the rationale is almost entirely A-centric and omits B\u2019s must-win context, consistency bias, and TE depth. The stated p_accept (0.35) is incongruent with how favorable this is for B. Minor coherence issues (calling it \u2018clearing committee RBs\u2019 while moving only King) and A overpaying for a TE upgrade also detract.",
