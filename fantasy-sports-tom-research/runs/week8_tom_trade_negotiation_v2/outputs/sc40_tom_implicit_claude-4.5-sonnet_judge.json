  "justification": "Team B is conservative and values pocket passers and playoff-friendly studs; the offer asks B to give up a Tier 1 WR with a friendly playoff schedule and their pocket QB for a Tier 4 dual-threat QB and a Tier 5 WR. That runs counter to B\u2019s stated preferences and 8-0 stability. The rationale is A-centric, ignores B\u2019s incentives, and the 0.62 accept probability is unrealistic. While the trade is feasible, it\u2019s value-imbalanced and misaligned with B\u2019s beliefs.",
