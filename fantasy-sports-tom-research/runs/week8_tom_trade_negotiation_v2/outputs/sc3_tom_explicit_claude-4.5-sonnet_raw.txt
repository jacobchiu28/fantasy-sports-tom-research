  "rationale": "Team B gets young breakout RB + WR depth; Team A gets low-volatility RB + rookie upside WR with friendly schedules",
  "p_accept_B": 0.62
}
```

**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B's manager values:
- Rookies with breakout potential (Devon Martinez fits this)
- Dual-threat QBs and young breakouts (already has several)
- Trusts expert consensus rankings
- Comfortable with playoff schedule advantages
- Willing to buy low on injured players

What Team B likely wants:
- RB depth with upside (they have committee backs but could use more young talent)
- WR depth with growth potential
- Players with favorable playoff schedules

How Team B would perceive this trade:
- **Trey Adams** (young breakout, low volatility, friendly playoff schedule) addresses their preference for emerging talent while providing RB consistency
- **Austin Garcia** (young breakout, mid volatility, outside WR) adds another developing player to their roster
- They're giving up **Ben King** (tough playoff matchups - negative for their schedule focus) and **Devon Martinez** (rookie but high volatility/deep threat)
- The trade swaps tough/mixed playoff schedules for friendly ones, aligning with their stated focus
- Consensus would likely favor young breakouts with better schedules
- Fair value exchange of similar-aged talent with schedule upgrade

Team A benefits by acquiring low-volatility RB (Ben King) fitting their consistency preference and a high-upside rookie (Martinez) they can afford to roster given their strong record, while moving players that don't fit their risk-averse profile.
