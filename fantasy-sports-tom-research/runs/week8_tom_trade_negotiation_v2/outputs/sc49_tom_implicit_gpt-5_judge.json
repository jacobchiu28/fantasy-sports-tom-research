  "justification": "The offer targets B\u2019s floor-first mindset and aversion to boom/bust rookies, and the TE bye coverage is a thoughtful touch. However, B prioritizes workhorse RB usage and heavy touches; Kyle Garcia is a committee back, and TE depth is redundant behind a Tier 2 TE. The rationale is very brief and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s workload bias. Value-wise, A appears to overpay, making B\u2019s acceptance likely higher than 0.63. Overall ToM is decent but not nuanced.",
