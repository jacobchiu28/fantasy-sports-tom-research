  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s TE need but misreads B\u2019s priorities: B values dual-threat QBs and would be left without a healthy QB if trading James Jones. Overstates RB need despite B having a Tier 1 RB. Rationale is brief and lacks roster-depth analysis, bye/injury context, or contingency for B\u2019s QB slot. Acceptance probability seems inflated.",
