  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s need for TE help and rookie upside, but overstates Flores as \u201csteady\u201d despite being doubtful and low-consistency. Ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven tendencies and RB scarcity/value, making a Tier3 RB for Tier4 WR + doubtful TE unlikely. Separates A\u2019s RB depth goal from B\u2019s return, but reasoning is brief and generic with limited evidence. Trade is plausible but not well-tailored.",
