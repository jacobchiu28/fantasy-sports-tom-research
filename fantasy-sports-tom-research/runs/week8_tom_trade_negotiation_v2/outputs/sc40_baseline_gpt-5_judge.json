  "justification": "Proposal centers on Team A\u2019s needs and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking style and playoff-RB priority. Asking B to give up a Tier 2 RB with a friendly playoff schedule for two boom/bust WRs and a worse TE conflicts with B\u2019s values and roster construction. The trade is feasible and upgrades A\u2019s RB/TE, but it\u2019s a poor fit for B. Rationale is generic and lacks evidence-based reasoning about B\u2019s incentives.",
