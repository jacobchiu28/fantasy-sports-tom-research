  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s ceiling-chasing, but ignores B\u2019s preference for rookies/stacks and their fragile TE room (trading away Brandon Taylor with Walker doubtful). Calls it a TE upgrade for A despite Holt being Tier 3 vs Brandon Tier 4 and A\u2019s dislike of rookies. Overlooks A\u2019s injury caution while requesting the questionable Josh Martin. Rationale is brief and generic, with limited multi-agent reasoning.",
