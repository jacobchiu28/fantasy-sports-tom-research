  "justification": "B needs wins now and already has a serviceable QB; trading a healthy Tier 1 RB (Xavier Carter) for an Out QB (Logan Clark) conflicts with urgency and expert consensus. While B does target injured buy-lows and likes ceiling, the rationale incorrectly claims \u2018now\u2019 value and ignores B\u2019s RB-to-QB roster balance. The offer is value-skewed and timing-incoherent, with minimal, inaccurate explanation.",
