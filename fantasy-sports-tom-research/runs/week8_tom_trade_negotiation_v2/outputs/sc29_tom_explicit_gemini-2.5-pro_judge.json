  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s playoff-schedule preference and high-upside WRs, but ignores B\u2019s injury-buying tendency and QB depth (has Chris Lee). Calling this a QB upgrade for B is dubious: Caleb (Tier 4, questionable) vs Logan Clark (Tier 1, out). B likely prefers holding/buying injured studs, not selling them for lower-tier assets. Rationale is generic and thin on roles/health context. Trade seems A-tilted; acceptance odds look optimistic.",
