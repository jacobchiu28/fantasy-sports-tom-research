  "justification": "Rationale centers only on Team A and mislabels A\u2019s needs (A already has two Tier 1 TEs) while asking for an Out TE, violating A\u2019s injury-avoidance. No discussion of Team B\u2019s incentives or preferences; B would likely smash-accept a QB1/WR1 for an RB3 and injured TE, making the 0.45 acceptance estimate implausible. The trade logic and explanation are generic and inconsistent with stated manager profiles and roster contexts.",
