  "justification": "Misreads Team B: a conservative, consensus-driven 7-1 manager valuing workhorse RBs and health is unlikely to trade Tier 1 RB Xavier Rodriguez for a rookie committee RB (Tier 3) and a Tier 5 WR. Claims of \u201cstable veteran production\u201d for A are incorrect (Rodriguez is a young breakout; Lucas Allen is out). Little attention to B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and injury caution. Acceptance probability is overstated; rationale is shallow and inconsistent with roster contexts.",
