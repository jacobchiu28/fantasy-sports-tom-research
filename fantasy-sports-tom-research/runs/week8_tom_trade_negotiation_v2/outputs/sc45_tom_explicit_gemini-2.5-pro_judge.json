  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s WR depth and frames a playoff push, but ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven valuations: trading a Tier 2 WR (Isaiah) and Tier 2 RB (Roberts) for a Tier 5 RB (Robinson) is implausible. B prefers young ascending, healthy players; Isaiah\u2019s minor Q plus losing Roberts makes acceptance unlikely. A\u2019s injury-cautious profile clashes with targeting a Q WR. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t engage tiers, roles, or playoff schedules. The 0.6 acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
