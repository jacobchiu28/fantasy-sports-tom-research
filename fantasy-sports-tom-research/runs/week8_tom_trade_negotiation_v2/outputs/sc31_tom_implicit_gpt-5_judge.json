  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s possible RB depth need and playoff angles, but ignores that B values high-upside stars and already has a Tier 1 TE. Calling Chris Torres a TE upgrade over Ben Thompson is incorrect. The offer asks B to give up a Tier 1 WR and Tier 1 TE for Tier 4 pieces, making acceptance probability unrealistic. Rationale is brief and factually off, with poor separation of A\u2019s needs from B\u2019s incentives.",
