  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B might want young breakout players, but ignores B\u2019s urgent need for safe floors, consensus-following, and comfort buying low on injured. Mislabels David Campbell as a high-floor upgrade for A despite Tier 4 status and low-volume offense. Trade is legal but heavily favors B in value, making A\u2019s motive incoherent. Rationale is generic and lacks specifics on tiers, roles, injuries, or bye/usage context.",
