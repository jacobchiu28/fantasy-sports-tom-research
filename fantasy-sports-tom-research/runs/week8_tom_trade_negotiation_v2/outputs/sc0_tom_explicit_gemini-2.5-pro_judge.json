  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they prefer stable floors, possession WRs, and often buy injured players; this deal gives them a Tier 5 workhorse and a high-variance deep threat while losing a steady Tier 2 RB. \u2018Consolidates depth\u2019 is inaccurate for a 2-for-2. Little reference to B\u2019s veteran/possession preferences or injury-buying tendency. Acceptance probability seems inflated. Rationale is generic and not grounded in roster context.",
