  "justification": "Good recognition that B values reliability and would be wary of swapping a steady RB for volatile pieces, with clear separation of A vs. B incentives. However, it misreads value signals (Josh Robinson listed as Tier 5 and a rookie vs. B\u2019s preference for proven vets; Noah Carter is Tier 1, so Robinson isn\u2019t clearly indispensable). WR depth concerns for B are overstated. Explanation is specific but undercut by these inconsistencies.",
