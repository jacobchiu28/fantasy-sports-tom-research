  "justification": "Acknowledges B might value safe QB depth and playoff-friendly WR, but overlooks that B would lose their only strong TE (Noah Brown) and be stuck with a Tier 4 TE\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking style. Isaiah Thompson\u2019s minor injury and breakout profile also clash with B\u2019s veteran preference. B already has a healthy Tier 2 QB, making QB depth less pressing. Explanation is concise but too generic and optimistic about acceptance.",
