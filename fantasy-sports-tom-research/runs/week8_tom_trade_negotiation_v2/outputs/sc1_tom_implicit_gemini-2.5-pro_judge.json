  "justification": "B is conservative and values stable, high-usage RBs; Josh Flores (Tier 2, steady usage, friendly playoffs) fits that profile and isn\u2019t a surplus piece. The offer (Jordan Green Tier 4 committee, tough playoffs; James Campbell high-variance rookie) doesn\u2019t match B\u2019s preferences for floor/targets. The rationale is generic and ignores B\u2019s mindset/roster context, and p_accept is overstated. A\u2019s consolidation goal is coherent, but B\u2019s incentives are misread.",
