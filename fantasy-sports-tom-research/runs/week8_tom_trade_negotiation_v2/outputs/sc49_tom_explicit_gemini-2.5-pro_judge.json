  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s need for immediate, stable production and offers low-volatility RBs, but overlooks key beliefs: B values workhorse roles and high targets/touches\u2014Noah Brown is exactly that and B has no backup TE. The proposal creates a lineup hole for a conservative manager needing weekly floor now, making 0.65 acceptance optimistic. From A\u2019s side, paying two strong committee RBs (including a Tier 1) for a Tier 2 TE conflicts with A\u2019s ceiling-chasing style and seems inefficient. Explanation is brief and lacks roster-context details.",
