  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s QB surplus and A\u2019s need for a stable QB, but misreads B\u2019s preferences (pocket passers, possession WRs, injured buy-lows). Mislabels Trevor Brown as a possession WR and ignores that Brandon Hernandez is a volatile deep threat, not B\u2019s typical target. Trade is feasible value-wise and leverages B\u2019s QB depth, but A giving up its only workhorse RB conflicts with A\u2019s stated preferences. Rationale is terse and lacks player/roster-context detail.",
