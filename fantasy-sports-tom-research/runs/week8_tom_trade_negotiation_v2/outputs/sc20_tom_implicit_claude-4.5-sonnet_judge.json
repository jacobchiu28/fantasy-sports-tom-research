  "justification": "Fails to model Team B: they prefer young ascending players and dual-threat QBs; offer asks B to give up Jake Green (Tier 1) and Devon Lewis for a Tier 4 QB with declining role and a Tier 4 WR in a low-volume offense. The \u201cveteran stability\u201d claim is inaccurate. Though B has QB surplus, they\u2019d demand premium value, not a clear downgrade plus fringe WR. Rationale is generic, lacks roster/context specifics, and acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
