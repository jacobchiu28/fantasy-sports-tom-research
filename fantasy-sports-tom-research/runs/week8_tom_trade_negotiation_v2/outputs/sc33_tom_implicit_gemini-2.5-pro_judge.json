  "justification": "It nods to Team B\u2019s preference for stability but overlooks their reliance on expert rankings and preference for possession WRs. Trey Adams is a Tier 4 RB with a declining role\u2014unlikely to appeal to a conservative, consensus-driven 8-0 team with ample RB depth. Darian Anderson is a Tier 5 outside WR, not a possession type. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address roster context or playoff planning. The offer is feasible but not compelling; acceptance probability seems overstated.",
