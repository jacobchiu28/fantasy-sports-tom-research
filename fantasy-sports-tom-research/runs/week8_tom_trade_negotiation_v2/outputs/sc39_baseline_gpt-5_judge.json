  "justification": "Deal is structurally plausible: B needs a QB upgrade and has surplus TEs, making Holt-for-Brown concept coherent. But the rationale is A-centric and doesn\u2019t model B\u2019s contrarian mindset or preference for dual-threat upside, nor justify why B parts with Brown. It also ignores A\u2019s urgent need for wins while downgrading QB depth from Tier 2 to Tier 4. Explanation is clear but shallow, offering little explicit ToM reasoning.",
