  "justification": "Shows some awareness that B prefers floor players, offering a low-variance RB for B\u2019s WR depth. However, it mislabels Darian Anderson as a steady WR (he\u2019s mid-variance outside WR) and ignores B\u2019s preference for possession receivers and expert rankings (Adams is Tier 4 with declining role). Little discussion of A\u2019s urgent need for wins or B\u2019s ample RB depth. Feasible but thin, with limited, generic reasoning.",
