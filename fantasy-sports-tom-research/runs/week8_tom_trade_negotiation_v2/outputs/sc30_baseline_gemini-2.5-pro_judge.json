  "justification": "Recognizes Team B\u2019s RB need and Team A\u2019s TE weakness, but misses B\u2019s TE surplus and already deep WR room, and doesn\u2019t reflect B\u2019s urgency or consensus-driven mindset. Trade is incoherent for A: giving a Tier 2 deep-threat WR (which A values) plus a usable RB for a Tier 4 TE is a marginal upgrade. Targeting Michael Roberts instead of B\u2019s better TE (Jamal Jones) further weakens logic. Explanation is brief and generic, lacking role/usage and playoff-context detail.",
