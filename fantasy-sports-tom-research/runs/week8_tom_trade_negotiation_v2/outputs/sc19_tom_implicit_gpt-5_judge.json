  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s valuation: they trust consensus and wouldn\u2019t swap a Tier 1 TE (Walker) and an RB with a friendly playoff slate (Josh Garcia) for an injured TE5 (Wright) and an out RB (Hill). While B tolerates injury for upside, calling Wright a TE1 upgrade is incorrect. Team A\u2019s conservative, injury-averse style also clashes with targeting a doubtful TE and a committee RB rather than a workhorse. Rationale is brief and factually off, showing weak multi-agent reasoning.",
