  "justification": "Offer targets B\u2019s surplus at WR but ignores B\u2019s mindset in the rationale. While including an injured committee RB (buy-low) and a volatile WR loosely fits B\u2019s preferences, the model doesn\u2019t articulate that. Value is lopsided for a Tier 1 WR; TE add-in doesn\u2019t help B (already has Tier 1 TE). Reasoning is brief and A-centric, with minimal evidence of modeling B\u2019s beliefs, needs, or playoff priorities.",
