  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s interest in a young dual-threat QB and A\u2019s desire for low-volatility veterans. However, it overlooks B\u2019s reliance on Darian Taylor (Tier 2 TE) and creates a TE hole, while Caleb Jackson is only a Tier 4 QB\u2014 a marginal upgrade over B\u2019s current options. A\u2019s \u2018workhorse RB\u2019 preference isn\u2019t met by Malik Carter (committee). Rationale is brief and omits TE dynamics and roster context, making the 0.65 acceptance probability optimistic.",
