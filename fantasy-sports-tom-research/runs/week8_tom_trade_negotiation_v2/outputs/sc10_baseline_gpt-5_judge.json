  "justification": "Proposal misreads both sides. It claims a QB/TE upgrade for A, but A trades away a Tier 1 QB (Jake Green) and a Tier 3 TE for an Out Tier 5 QB (Lucas Carter) and a Q Tier 4 TE\u2014clear downgrade. No evidence of B\u2019s mindset (urgency for immediate points, floor/volume preferences). Explanation is terse, incorrect, and not grounded in roster/health context. While B might accept due to massive QB upgrade, the rationale ignores B and is internally incoherent.",
