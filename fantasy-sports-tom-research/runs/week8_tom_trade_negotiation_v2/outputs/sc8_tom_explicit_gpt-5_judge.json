  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s Week 12 QB need and desire for steady contributors, but overlooks that B highly values possession WRs (Thomas) and avoids injuries (Garcia Q). Calls Noah a TE1 upgrade despite B already having a healthy Tier 2 TE. Also inconsistent with A\u2019s strict injury aversion by targeting Thomas (Q). Reasoning is concise but thin on roster/context specifics and mischaracterizes value dynamics.",
