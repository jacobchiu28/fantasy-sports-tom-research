  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s WR volatility but misreads B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven preference for stable workhorse RBs\u2014Flores precisely fits that. Offering a mid-variance WR3 (Brown) and a committee RB3 (Carter) won\u2019t appeal, especially with B\u2019s RB depth stressed by Alex White\u2019s injury. The 2-for-1 de-consolidation clashes with B\u2019s risk profile. Rationale is brief and generic, lacking usage/bye considerations and B\u2019s playoff incentives. Trade is coherent but unlikely.",
