  "justification": "Rationale focuses only on Team A\u2019s desire for stability and ignores Team B\u2019s incentives. No modeling of B\u2019s upside preference or willingness to take on injured/volatile assets. The trade is wildly lopsided (A sends a Tier 1 RB and Tier 2 WR for B\u2019s Tier 3 RB with declining role), conflicting with A\u2019s urgent need to win and conservative style. Explanation is concise but generic, with minimal scenario grounding and no discussion of B\u2019s motivations.",
