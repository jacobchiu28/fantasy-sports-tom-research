  "justification": "B is conservative and prefers stable floors/workhorse RBs. The offer sends B a volatile deep-threat WR (Ethan Jones) and a committee RB (Michael Walker), while asking for B\u2019s steadier Tier 1 WR (Matt Nguyen). That reverses B\u2019s stated preferences. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives, roster composition, or player roles. Acceptance probability is overstated given B\u2019s style and need for reliability. Overall, weak ToM and thin justification.",
