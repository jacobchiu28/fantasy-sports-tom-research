  "justification": "The offer hints that B might swap an injured QB for immediate RB help, but it misses B\u2019s stated love of dual-threat QBs and buying low on injured players\u2014making parting with Logan Clark unlikely. The rationale is A-centric and sparse. The move also contradicts A\u2019s conservative, floor-first style by trading a workhorse RB and steady WR for two injured assets and a QB with tough playoff matchups. Overall coherence is middling and the explanation lacks detail.",
