  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s preference for consistency and injured buy-lows: Moore/Taylor are high-variance WRs, while Liam Torres is a committee RB with a Q tag and Ethan Turner isn\u2019t a reliable TE upgrade. Minimal separation of A vs. B incentives, and A\u2019s injury-cautious profile conflicts with acquiring Torres. The rationale mislabels Torres\u2019 workload and Turner\u2019s reliability, and provides almost no evidence. Acceptance probability seems overstated.",
