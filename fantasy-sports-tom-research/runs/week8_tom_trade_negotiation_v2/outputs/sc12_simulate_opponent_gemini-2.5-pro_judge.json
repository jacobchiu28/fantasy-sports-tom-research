  "justification": "Shows some ToM by sending B a dual-threat QB/high-upside package, but ignores B\u2019s IR QB context explicitly. Proposal badly hurts A\u2019s win-now chances by downgrading from a Tier 1 RB to a declining Tier 3 RB and from a Tier 3 QB to a Tier 4 QB. Rationale is generic, not evidence-based. Archetype fit is loosely coherent, but strategy is lopsided toward B; B\u2019s acceptance likely >0.7.",
