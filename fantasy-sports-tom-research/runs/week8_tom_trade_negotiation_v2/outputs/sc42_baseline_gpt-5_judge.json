  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s consistency/schedule focus. B gives a healthy workhorse with a friendly playoff slate for two committee RBs (one with declining role) and a volatile deep-threat WR with tough playoff matchups\u2014poor fit for B\u2019s preferences. Rationale is A-centric and vague, not explaining B\u2019s incentive or leveraging B\u2019s TE depth convincingly. Trade is feasible and offloads B\u2019s Q TE, but value logic is muddled (requesting a Tier-5 \u2018workhorse\u2019 while A ships a Tier-1 RB).",
