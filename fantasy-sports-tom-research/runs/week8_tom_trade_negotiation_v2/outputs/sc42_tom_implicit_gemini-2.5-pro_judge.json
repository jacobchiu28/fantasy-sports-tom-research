  "justification": "Slight nod to B\u2019s desire for reliability, but it ignores B\u2019s injury aversion by offering an Out RB and overstates playoff schedule benefits. Campbell isn\u2019t clearly the possession-type B prefers, and the rationale doesn\u2019t reference B\u2019s TE surplus or SoS focus meaningfully. The offer is mechanically feasible and somewhat logical (A needs TE; B has TE depth), but acceptance odds seem overstated. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
