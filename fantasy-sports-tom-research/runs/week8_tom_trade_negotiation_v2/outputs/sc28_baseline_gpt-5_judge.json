It asks B to give a Tier 1 RB (Alex Thompson) and an injured RB for a dual-threat QB B doesn\u2019t value, a volatile rookie WR, and a low-tier rookie TE\u2014positions B already covers (Holt at QB, Alex Thomas at TE). B prioritizes volume and veterans, and is comfortable buying injured players, not selling them. Rationale only addresses A\u2019s needs and is generic.",
