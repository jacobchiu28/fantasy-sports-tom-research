  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-first values by offering a volatile committee RB and a high-variance rookie deep threat for B\u2019s low-vol RB and steadier WR. While it notes different aims for A and B, it incorrectly assumes B wants upside rookies. The trade is structurally feasible, but risk profiles and player archetypes don\u2019t fit B\u2019s stated preferences. Rationale is sparse and not grounded in the scenario\u2019s specific priorities.",
