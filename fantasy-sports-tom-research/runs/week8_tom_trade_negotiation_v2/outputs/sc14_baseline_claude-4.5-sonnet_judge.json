  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, veteran-preferring mindset and desire for stable floors/high-powered offenses. Asking B to give up a low-volatility RB (Ethan Campbell) for a high-variance RB (Sean Holt) and a boom/bust rookie WR (Darian Robinson) clashes with B\u2019s values. Rationale only reflects Team A\u2019s goal of stabilizing, not why B would accept. Claim of gaining WR consistency via Brandon Martinez (Tier 5) is unconvincing. Trade is feasible but poorly aligned with B\u2019s incentives.",
