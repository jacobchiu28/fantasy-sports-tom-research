  "B_profile_reasoning": "B is 0-8, needs immediate starters. Contrarian, avoids injuries, values committee RBs and dual-threat QBs. TE is weakest spot; QB is surplus (Jones + Clark). Receiving TE Brown (young breakout) + committee RB Taylor fit B\u2019s prefs and raise weekly ceiling. Trading veteran Jones (keep Clark) feels fair for 2 startable assets without injury risk.",
