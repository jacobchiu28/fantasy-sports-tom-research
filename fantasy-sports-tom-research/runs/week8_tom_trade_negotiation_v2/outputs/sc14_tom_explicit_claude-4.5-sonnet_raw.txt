**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B's manager is extremely conservative, preferring stable weekly floors over boom/bust players. They value proven veterans with track records and are willing to roster injured players for upside. They target high-powered offenses.

Looking at what Team B would want:
- They're thin at RB with only committee backs (Jordan Green, Noah Carter, Ethan Campbell)
- Sean Holt is a high-volatility committee back but represents a "young breakout" with upside
- Isaiah Thompson is mid-volatility outside WR with friendly playoff schedule - more stable than their current high-volatility WR corps

What Team B would give up:
- Ethan Campbell: low-volatility veteran RB with friendly playoff schedule - fits Team A's need to avoid injury-prone players and adds stable floor
- Trevor Martin: mid-volatility veteran deep-threat WR - fits Team A's preference for deep threats while being more stable than their current high-volatility options

Team B likely perceives this as slightly unfavorable because they're trading away their most stable RB (Ethan Campbell) for higher-variance pieces, which conflicts with their conservative style. However, the young breakout upside and playoff schedule improvements might justify consideration. Probability of acceptance is moderate-low given the philosophical mismatch.
