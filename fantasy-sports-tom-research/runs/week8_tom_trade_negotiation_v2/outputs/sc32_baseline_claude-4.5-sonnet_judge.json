Mislabels Austin Reed as a surplus QB3 despite Tier 1 status and offers him plus a Tier 1 TE for an Out Tier 3 TE\u2014contradicts \u2018upgrade TE\u2019 rationale. No acknowledgment of B\u2019s TE context (would love immediate TE) or that B might prefer keeping injured upside but still value immediate production. Acceptance probability is unjustified. Overall, A-centric, logically inconsistent, and weakly reasoned.",
