  "justification": "Shows basic ToM by noting B\u2019s RB need and A\u2019s desire for stable WRs, but ignores B\u2019s urgent-win context (playoff schedule cited instead) and B\u2019s preference for consensus/possession profiles. Trade is feasible: Tier 3 steady RB for Tier 4 steady-ish WR fits both rosters, though value may favor B. Explanation is overly brief and misses roster depth, bye impacts, and usage details. Overall, passable but shallow perspective-taking.",
