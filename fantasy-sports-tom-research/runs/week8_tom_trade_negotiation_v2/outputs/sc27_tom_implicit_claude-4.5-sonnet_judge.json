  "justification": "Team B needs immediate, consistent production and values workhorse RBs; this offer asks for B\u2019s best RB and WR while giving a QB downgrade (Ethan T4 vs B\u2019s Sam Martinez T2) and a WR2. It ignores B\u2019s thin RB depth and win-now urgency. The rationale mischaracterizes roles (\u201cQB stability,\u201d \u201cpossession WR\u201d) and doesn\u2019t create a stack or fit B\u2019s preferences. Overall lopsided and unrealistic for B.",
