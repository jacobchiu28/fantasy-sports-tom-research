  "justification": "Reasonable roster fit (B has RB depth, WR scarcity), but minimal ToM. It ignores B\u2019s contrarian, injury-averse preference for established, healthy players and playoff schedules: Justin Miller is questionable with tough playoff matchups; Foster\u2019s role is declining; Liam Carter has a friendly playoff slate. Rationale describes only A\u2019s benefit and offers no B-centric incentives. Feasible, but unlikely to match B\u2019s motivations.",
