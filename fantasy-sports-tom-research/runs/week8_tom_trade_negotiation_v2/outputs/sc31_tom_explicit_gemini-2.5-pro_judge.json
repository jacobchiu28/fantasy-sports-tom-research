  "justification": "Good read that Team B lacks RB depth and targets injured/committee upside; offering a doubtful Tier 2 RB plus a committee back aligns with those tastes. It also states Team A\u2019s consolidation goal. However, it underrates Jordan Rivera\u2019s Tier 1 value and overestimates B\u2019s acceptance; a 7-1 team may prefer elite consolidation over a 2-for-1. Rationale is brief and doesn\u2019t cite playoff schedule/O-line factors B values. Trade is plausible but light for Rivera.",
