  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s clear injury aversion by sending an IR QB for a healthy Tier 2 RB. Rationale is A-centric and even incorrect (\u201cthree starting QBs\u201d when one is IR), showing little regard for B\u2019s incentives or consensus-driven mindset. While B likely needs a QB, the proposal doesn\u2019t address that they\u2019d want a healthy, reliable option. Explanation is generic and not grounded in profiles.",
