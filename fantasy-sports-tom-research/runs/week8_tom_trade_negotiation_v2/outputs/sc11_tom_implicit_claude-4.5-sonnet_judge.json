  "justification": "Team B needs stable points and values workhorse RBs and possession WRs; this asks them to trade a Tier 2 RB and a possession WR for a volatile committee RB and high-variance WR. The rationale ignores B\u2019s incentives and mislabels Josh Flores as a workhorse. Little evidence of B-side thinking (injury buy-low, stacks, urgency). While structurally feasible, it\u2019s lopsided and unlikely to appeal to B\u2019s preferences. The 0.42 acceptance estimate seems optimistic given misalignment.",
