  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s priorities (needs reliable producers, values RBs/possession WRs, and has injured TE). Offering a volatile WR (Sam Martin) and a low-tier, inconsistent TE (Ethan Turner) for B\u2019s Tier 2 RB (Josh Flores) is misaligned. Calling Mason Mitchell a \u2018more stable WR\u2019 is inaccurate (deep threat, Q-tag, Tier 4). Rationale is A-centric, generic, and not grounded in roster/context specifics.",
