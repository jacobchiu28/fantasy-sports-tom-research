  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s conservatism but misreads needs: claims TE surplus when B\u2019s only strong TE is Noah Brown, and labels Isaiah as \u201csteadier\u201d despite Q tag and breakout profile. Eric Torres is boom/bust, not floor-friendly. Trade fits A\u2019s TE need but leaves B with TE4 and swaps a Tier-1 WR for two volatile WRs. Rationale is terse and light on specifics; acceptance probability seems optimistic.",
