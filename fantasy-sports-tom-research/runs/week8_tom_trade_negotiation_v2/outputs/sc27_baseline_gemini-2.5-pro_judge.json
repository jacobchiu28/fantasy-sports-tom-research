  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s stated preference for workhorse RBs and established, reliable talent; it offers a WR2 and TE4 for B\u2019s elite but injured TE1. It also overlooks B\u2019s WR depth and urgent need for immediate, dependable production at thin positions. Team A\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile clashes with targeting a Doubtful TE. Rationale centers only on A\u2019s goals and provides no B-focused reasoning, making acceptance probability overstated and the logic underdeveloped.",
