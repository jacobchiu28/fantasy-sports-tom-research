  "justification": "B prioritizes volume, stability, SOS, and possession WRs. Cameron Holt (T2, steady usage) fits B perfectly, while Nick Holt (T4, more volatile) is a downgrade, not a \u2018possession WR upgrade.\u2019 B also loses Josh Garcia (T2 RB, friendly playoff schedule) for Alex Mitchell (T3 RB, mixed outlook), conflicting with B\u2019s SOS/volume focus. Both managers are conservative; this increases B\u2019s volatility. The acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is brief and mischaracterizes player profiles, showing weak ToM for B.",
