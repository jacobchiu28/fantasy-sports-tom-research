  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s zero-RB philosophy\u2014this deal consolidates into RB and costs them WR depth. B trusts consensus and values touches; Hernandez (Tier 1, friendly playoff slate) is a lateral swap with Taylor, making the added WR giveaway irrational. Rationale is generic and incorrectly frames Hernandez as merely a committee back. Little separation of A\u2019s interests from B\u2019s incentives, and the 0.68 accept probability is unrealistic.",
