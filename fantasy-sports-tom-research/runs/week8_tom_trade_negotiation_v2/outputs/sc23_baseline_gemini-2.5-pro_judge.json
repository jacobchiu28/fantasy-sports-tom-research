  "justification": "Explanation is A-centric and doesn\u2019t model B\u2019s mindset. Team B favors upside and is comfortable buying low on injured players, making it less likely they sell a Tier 1 (though doubtful) TE. B already has RB depth (Thompson/Lewis/Flores), so adding another RB doesn\u2019t address TE scarcity. The trade itself is feasible and positionally logical for A, but misses B\u2019s incentives and roster context, and the rationale lacks detail.",
