  "justification": "Team B already has multiple Tier 1 QBs (Jake Green, Chris Reed, Cameron Harris); Ethan Torres (Tier 4) is not an upgrade. David Campbell (Tier 4, low-volume veteran) conflicts with B\u2019s preference for young ascending players in high-powered offenses. The deal asks B to give up a top dual-threat QB and RB depth for bench pieces, ignores B\u2019s likely TE need, and mislabels the value. The rationale is generic and factually incorrect, and the acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
