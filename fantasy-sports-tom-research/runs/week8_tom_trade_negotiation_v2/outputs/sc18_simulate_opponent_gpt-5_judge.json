  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s schedule focus and offers RB depth, but ignores B\u2019s strong preference for possession receivers and reliance on expert rankings. Mislabels Ethan Turner (Tier 4) as a TE upgrade over B\u2019s Darian Taylor (Tier 2). A\u2019s claim of acquiring a steadier WR is weak since Mason Torres is an outside, mid-variance option. Trade would also thin B\u2019s WR depth. Some two-sided reasoning exists, but rationale is brief and partially inaccurate.",
