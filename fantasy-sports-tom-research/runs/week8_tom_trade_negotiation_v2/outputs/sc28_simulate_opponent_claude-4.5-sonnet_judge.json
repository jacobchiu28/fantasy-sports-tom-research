  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs and values: B already has multiple stable pocket QBs, so Lucas Hall adds little. Asking for Ben King (a low-variance RB B needs) and Austin Torres while offering an injured WR (Derek Harris) undermines B\u2019s urgent-win, floor-first mindset despite comfort with injuries. Roles are mislabeled (Harris as possession, Torres as consistent-target WR). The acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and not roster- or context-specific.",
