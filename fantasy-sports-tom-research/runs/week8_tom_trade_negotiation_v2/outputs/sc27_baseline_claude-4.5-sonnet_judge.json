  "justification": "Offer benefits A\u2019s stability goals but ignores B\u2019s beliefs and needs. B is 0-8, values consistency and healthy players, and would be asked to give up their most reliable RB and a steadier QB for an injured, high-variance QB and a volatile WR. Little evidence of modeling B\u2019s priorities or urgency; rationale is generic and self-focused. Trade is feasible but contextually misaligned with B\u2019s incentives.",
