  "justification": "Good read on B\u2019s WR depth, RB scarcity, youth and playoff-schedule preferences, and A\u2019s upside focus. However, asking two Tier-2 WRs for a Tier-5 RB plus Tier-3 WR is value-skewed, clashing with B\u2019s consensus-trusting profile. Calling A\u2019s return \u201chealthier WRs\u201d ignores Isaiah Thompson\u2019s Q tag and A\u2019s injury caution. The acceptance probability is optimistic. Reasoning is mostly grounded but has gaps and an incomplete rationale.",
