  "justification": "Proposal targets B\u2019s floor players (Ben King, Austin Torres) while sending B higher-variance pieces (Marcus Reed, Trevor Rodriguez), contrary to B\u2019s conservative, floor-first preferences. Rationale centers on A\u2019s gains (floor stability, volatility reduction) with no clear benefit articulated for B. Trade structure is positionally coherent and plausibly valued, but the playoff-schedule claim is thin. Overall ToM toward B is weak, matching the low acceptance estimate.",
