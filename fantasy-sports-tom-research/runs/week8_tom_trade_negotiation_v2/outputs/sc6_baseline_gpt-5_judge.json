  "justification": "Ignores Team B\u2019s preferences and situation: B values dual-threat QBs and immediate upside at 0-8; Jones fits that, Flores doesn\u2019t. B already has strong RB depth, so a Tier-4 RB adds little. The \u201ctough playoff\u201d angle helps A, not B. The swap is mechanically feasible (QB-for-QB plus RB) but misaligned with B\u2019s incentives. Rationale is terse and A-centric with minimal evidence.",
