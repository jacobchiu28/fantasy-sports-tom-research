  "justification": "Team B values consistent possession WRs and already has a healthy Tier 2 TE, so Noah Brown isn\u2019t a clear upgrade and swapping out Darian Thomas (their lone low-variance WR) for a deep-threat WR is misaligned. Team A\u2019s ultra-conservative, injury-averse profile conflicts with targeting a Questionable player. Player tiers suggest B downgrades at WR and only makes a lateral TE move, making the 55% acceptance unlikely and the rationale generic.",
