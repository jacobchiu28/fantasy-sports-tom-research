Perspective-taking is weak: it claims A \u2018consolidates for a stable starter\u2019 while A receives an Out Tier-5 WR despite needing wins now. Consistency suffers from overstated upgrade and misaligned A incentives. Explanation is generic and not grounded in player tiers/roles or B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven mindset.",
