  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s 4-4 status and appetite for upside/rookies, and frames A as seeking safety. However, it misses B\u2019s RB surplus and WR need specifics, and ignores B\u2019s comfort with injury risk beyond a mention. The offer is lopsided toward B (A gives a Tier 1 RB and Tier 2 WR for a Tier 2 RB and Tier 4 WR), undermining A\u2019s stated goals. Calling the return a \u2018breakout WR\u2019 is tenuous, and the acceptance probability seems low given value to B. Rationale is too terse and under-evidenced.",
