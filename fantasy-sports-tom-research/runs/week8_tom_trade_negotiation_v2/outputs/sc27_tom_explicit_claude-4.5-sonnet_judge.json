  "justification": "They name B\u2019s priorities (consistency, RB workload, stacks) but misapply them: proposing B trade its most reliable RB (Sam Lewis) and Tier 1 WR (Nick Torres) for a Tier 4 QB (Ethan) and a Tier 2 WR. B already has a Tier 2 QB, making this a downgrade, and the assumed QB-WR stack is unsupported. The rationale is clear but factually off and inconsistent with B\u2019s needs and preferences.",
