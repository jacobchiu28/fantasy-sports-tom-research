  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they value reliable RB workloads and consistency, not \u2018shake-up\u2019 upside WRs. Asking for B\u2019s most stable RB (Sam Lewis) for a declining-role, boom-bust WR (Devon Moore) clashes with B\u2019s needs and preferences. Ignores B\u2019s TE issues and stack preference. Value/tier imbalance and inflated 0.7 accept probability. Rationale is generic and lacks roster- or context-specific evidence.",
