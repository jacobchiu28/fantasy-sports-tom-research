  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s appetite for ceiling/rookies (Nick Torres + volatile Garcia) and A\u2019s desire for steadier pieces (Ben King, low-variance Scott). However, it underestimates B\u2019s likely reluctance to trade a Tier 1 rookie (Scott) and to lose RB depth for a Tier 5 WR. It also glosses over A\u2019s preference for proven vets and urgent win-now needs. The rationale is terse and light on roster/usage context, making the 0.6 acceptance estimate optimistic.",
