  "justification": "Offer suits Team A\u2019s needs (RB floor, fill TE hole) but ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-first mindset. B parts with a low-volatility RB (Ethan Campbell) and a depth TE for a mid-volatility committee RB (Malik Moore) and a high-variance WR with a declining role (Darian Moore). Little evidence the proposer modeled B\u2019s preferences or roster strengths (already deep at WR, has TE depth). Explanation is terse and one-sided.",
