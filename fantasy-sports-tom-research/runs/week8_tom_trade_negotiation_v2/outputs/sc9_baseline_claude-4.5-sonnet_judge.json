  "justification": "Ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile and urgent need for stable, healthy starters. Offering a questionable committee RB and boom/bust deep threat for B\u2019s workhorse RB misfits their preferences; zero-RB only makes sense if WR/TE return improves floor, which it doesn\u2019t. The \u2018receiving TE upgrade\u2019 claim is inconsistent since Roberts (Tier 4) isn\u2019t an upgrade over A\u2019s TE options. Rationale is A-centric and lacks evidence tied to B\u2019s incentives or playoff/win-now context. Low accept chance is stated but not well justified.",
