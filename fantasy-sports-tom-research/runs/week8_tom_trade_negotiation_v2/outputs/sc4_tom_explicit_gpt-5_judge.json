  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s 7-1 upside mindset but misreads TE \u201csurplus\u201d (Walker doubtful, Gonzalez questionable; Brandon Taylor is B\u2019s healthy pass-catching TE). Ignores B\u2019s rookie-preference (Alex Thompson isn\u2019t a rookie) and existing RB depth. For A, swapping a Tier 1 RB for a Tier 4 rookie TE conflicts with A\u2019s preference for proven, consistent veterans and is a major value loss. Rationale is brief and lacks roster/context details. Multi-perspective is present but shallow and the offer is unrealistic.",
