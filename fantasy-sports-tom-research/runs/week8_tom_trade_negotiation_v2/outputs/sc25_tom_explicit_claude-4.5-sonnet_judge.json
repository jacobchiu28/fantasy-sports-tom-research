  "justification": "Good recognition of B\u2019s dual-threat QB preference, zero-RB lean, and reliance on consensus, but it overlooks that B highly values rookies\u2014Cameron Scott (Tier 1 rookie) is exactly the type B would avoid trading. It also overstates B\u2019s QB \u2018need\u2019 given Holt\u2019s stability and playoff schedule, and doesn\u2019t leverage B\u2019s injury-buy tendency. Trade is feasible but misaligned with B\u2019s philosophy, likely overestimating acceptance and calling it a zero-RB fit despite sacrificing elite WR capital without WR return.",
