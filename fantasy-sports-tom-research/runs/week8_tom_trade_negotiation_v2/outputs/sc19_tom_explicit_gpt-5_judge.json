  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s values/roster: calls Justin Wright (Tier 5, Out, declining role) a TE upgrade over B\u2019s Tier 1 Walker and Tier 2 Allen. Mislabels Austin Wright (veteran) as rookie fit and calls Josh Garcia ascending despite listed declining role. Contradicts Team A\u2019s injury-averse profile by asking for doubtful Walker. Trade is severely lopsided against B and the p_accept_B=0.6 is unrealistic. Some attempt at perspective (SoS, rookies) but applied inaccurately.",
