  "justification": "Shows minimal ToM. It notes B\u2019s possession WR but ignores that B highly values and thus is unlikely to trade Thomas, prefers pocket passers (not White), and is injury-averse (both incoming players carry concerns). B already has a Tier 1 QB, so White is a poor fit. The offer lacks alignment with B\u2019s urgent-win needs and archetype preferences, making the 0.72 accept rate unrealistic. Rationale is generic and thin on roster/context specifics.",
