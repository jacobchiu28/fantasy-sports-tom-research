  "justification": "Rationale focuses on Team A only and ignores Team B\u2019s risk-seeking, rookie-upside mindset. It inaccurately calls Brandon Taylor a \u201ctop TE\u201d and overlooks Team A\u2019s injury aversion while requesting a questionable Josh Martin. The trade is structurally plausible (A upgrades TE depth and swaps RBs; B gains a high-ceiling rookie WR), but the reasoning is generic and thin on scenario-specific details.",
