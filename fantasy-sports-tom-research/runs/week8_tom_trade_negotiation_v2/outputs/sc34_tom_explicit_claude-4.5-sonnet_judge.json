  "justification": "Understands B\u2019s need for stable floors and win-now schedules, offering a low-variance QB upgrade and steady RB. However, it underplays B\u2019s preference for young ascending players and doesn\u2019t note Harris\u2019s minor injury risk. Perspective-taking is fair but doesn\u2019t articulate A\u2019s upside-seeking motives. The trade is coherent given B\u2019s weak QB room and RB depth, but the rationale is very brief and misses specific roster-context details.",
