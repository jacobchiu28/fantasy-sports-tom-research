  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s desire for floor and pocket QB, offering Harris/Campbell accordingly. However, it overlooks B\u2019s reliance on consensus rankings and preference for young ascending players, making surrendering Tier-1 RB Marcus Reed unlikely. The trade is structurally coherent (QB upgrade for RB downgrade) but thinly justified and light on schedule/role details. Acceptance odds seem optimistic.",
