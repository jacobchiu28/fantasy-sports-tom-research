  "justification": "Proposal barely models Team B\u2019s mindset. It ignores B\u2019s elite RB value, existing TE strength (has a Tier 1 TE), and preference for high-upside/injured targets with playoff edges. Throw-ins are low-tier (two Tier 4 TEs, Tier 5 rookie WR) and don\u2019t match B\u2019s needs despite liking rookies. Rationale is Team A\u2013centric and generic. While a 3-for-1 is structurally coherent, it\u2019s value-incoherent for a 7\u20131 team giving up a Tier 1 RB.",
