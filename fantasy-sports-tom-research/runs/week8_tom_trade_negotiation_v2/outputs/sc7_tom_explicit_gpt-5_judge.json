  "justification": "Accurately notes B\u2019s appetite for upside and interest in rookies/boom WRs and committee RBs, and mentions bye clustering. However, it overlooks that trading Sam Foster leaves B with only Chris Adams, who has a Week 9 bye\u2014critical for a 3\u20135 team. It also miscasts Devon Moore as a steadier WR and ignores A\u2019s preference for pocket passers/possession WRs. Overall reasoning is partially ToM-aware but misses key contextual constraints.",
