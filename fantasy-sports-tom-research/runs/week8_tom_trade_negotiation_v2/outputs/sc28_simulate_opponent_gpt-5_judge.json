  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s dislike of volatility (moving off a volatile RB) but ignores key beliefs: B already has a Tier 1 TE (Thomas), values stable volume, and needs active RB depth. Offering a Tier 2 TE plus an OUT WR as a \u201csteadier WR\u201d misreads B\u2019s priorities despite their willingness to buy low on injuries. The trade is roster-incoherent for B and the acceptance probability is overstated. Reasoning is brief and factually off.",
