  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s record, zero-RB lean, and dual-threat QB preference, but shallow. Offer heavily favors B (RB1 + Tier-1 QB for WR3 + TE4), so A\u2019s incentive is unclear and p_accept_B=0.52 is implausibly low. Minimal separation of motives; A already has TE1 depth and values dual-threat QBs yet trades away their only healthy one. Context (roster needs, playoff schedules, injury tendencies) is barely used. Feasible but strategically incoherent for A.",
