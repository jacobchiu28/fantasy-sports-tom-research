Calling Trevor Martin a steadier WR2 is unsupported versus A\u2019s existing options and similar-tier Kyle Mitchell. The trade is feasible and could incidentally appeal to B\u2019s upside lean, but that\u2019s not articulated. Value/coherence are shaky: A overpays with a Tier 2 RB for a Tier 4 WR, conflicting with the stated goal.",
