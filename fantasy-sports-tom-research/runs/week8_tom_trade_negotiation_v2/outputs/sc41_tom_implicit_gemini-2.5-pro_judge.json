  "justification": "Mentions B needs wins, but misreads B\u2019s values: calls an Out tier-5 WR a weekly starter and ignores B\u2019s preference for consistency. Labels Noah Brown a \u201cstud\u201d while offering A\u2019s tier-1 RB, which A likely shouldn\u2019t trade given RB depth and existing TE strength. Little separation of A\u2019s ceiling-chasing goals from B\u2019s reliability focus. Trade is feasible and might appeal to B due to a big RB upgrade, but rationale is generic and fact-light.",
