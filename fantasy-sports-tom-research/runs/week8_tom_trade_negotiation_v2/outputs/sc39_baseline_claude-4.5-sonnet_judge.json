  "justification": "Including Derek White nods to Team B\u2019s dual\u2011threat QB preference and QB need (given Lucas Carter is out), and the low p_accept_B shows some awareness of pushback. However, it ignores B\u2019s valuation of a Tier 1 RB (Noah Carter) and offers an out RB as ballast, making it lopsided. The rationale is A-centric, omits B\u2019s contrarian tendencies and playoff security, and lacks detail on roles/schedules. Trade is feasible but not sensibly balanced for B.",
