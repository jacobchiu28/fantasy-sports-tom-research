  "justification": "Correctly targets B\u2019s dual-threat QB preference and lets B unload an injured WR, but ignores B\u2019s fondness for deep-threat WRs and the risk of weakening B\u2019s RB corps by losing Harris. A\u2019s return (floor RB) conflicts with A\u2019s ceiling-chasing style. Rationale is terse and doesn\u2019t reference B\u2019s QB scarcity, injury avoidance, or strength-of-schedule details. Trade is feasible but only moderately aligned with both sides\u2019 incentives.",
