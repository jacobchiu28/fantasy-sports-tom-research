  "justification": "The proposal barely models Team B\u2019s priorities. It ignores B\u2019s preference for proven veterans and possession WRs and their 8-0 incentive to keep stability. It also fails to explicitly leverage B\u2019s TE injuries, despite offering a rookie Tier 4 TE. The trade is somewhat coherent (B needs TE depth), but value is light for a workhorse RB. Rationale is brief and Team A\u2013centric without evidence-based reasoning.",
