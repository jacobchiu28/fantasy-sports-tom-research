  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s mindset and needs: B values breakout WRs and has TE injuries, so trading Austin Torres plus their ascending rookie TE is unlikely. The rationale mislabels the return as \u201cconsistent\u201d when Torres is mid-variance and the TE is a rookie. For Team A, giving up a Tier 1 RB for WR2 + TE4 mismatches their preference for reliable possession WRs and proven veterans. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
