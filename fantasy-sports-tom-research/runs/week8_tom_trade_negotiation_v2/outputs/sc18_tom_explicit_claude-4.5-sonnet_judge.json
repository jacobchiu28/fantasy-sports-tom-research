  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they prefer stable floors and possession WRs and seek injured buy-lows, yet A offers a healthy deep-threat (Brandon Hernandez, high variance) and a volatile committee RB (Sean Holt). Claim that B gets injury-buy candidates is incorrect. Return for A (Josh Robinson Tier 5 in low-volume offense; Austin Torres mid-variance) only partially fits A\u2019s preferences. Rationale is brief and inaccurate; acceptance probability likely overstated.",
