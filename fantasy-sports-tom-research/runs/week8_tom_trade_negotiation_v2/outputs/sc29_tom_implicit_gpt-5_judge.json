  "justification": "Shows some ToM: matches B\u2019s taste for deep-threat WRs and injured buy-low (Eric Davis) and notes playoff schedule. Also offers RB depth and a QB while B\u2019s starter is out. But it overlooks that Trey is likely a downgrade from Chris Lee, B values rookies (making Josh Robinson harder to pry), and both teams need immediate points, making a doubtful WR unhelpful. Trade is feasible but value and timing are shaky; explanation is brief and generic.",
