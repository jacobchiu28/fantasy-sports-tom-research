  "justification": "The offer nods to Team B\u2019s floor preference but misreads their valuation: Austin Torres is their best WR (Tier 2, ascending, friendly playoff schedule) and suits their conservative style. Ben King is a Tier 3 committee back with a declining role and tough playoff slate\u2014unlikely to rank above Torres. Team B\u2019s WR depth is thin, they trust expert rankings, and their injury-buying tendency isn\u2019t leveraged. The 0.65 accept probability is optimistic. Rationale is brief and lacks concrete roster/context details.",
