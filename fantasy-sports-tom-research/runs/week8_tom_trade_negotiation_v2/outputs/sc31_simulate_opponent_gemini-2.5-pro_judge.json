  "justification": "Team B already has a Tier 1 TE (Ben Thompson), so TE isn\u2019t a \u2018huge need.\u2019 Trading a Tier 1 WR (Jordan Rivera) for a Tier 4 RB (Liam) and Tier 4 TE (Chris) is a major value gap, conflicting with B\u2019s consensus-trusting profile. RB depth is a mild need, but not at the cost of Rivera. Playoff schedule mentions help, yet the rationale is generic and overstates needs. Acceptance probability is far too high.",
