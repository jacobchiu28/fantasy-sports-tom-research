  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and barely models B\u2019s beliefs. B values deep\u2011threat WRs and consensus safety; Foster is a slot possession WR and Nguyen isn\u2019t a clear deep threat, plus he has a tough playoff schedule\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s stated preferences and schedule focus. B also risks thinning RB depth by giving up a Tier 2 ascending back while already holding several WRs. The trade is feasible on value, but the explanation lacks detail on B\u2019s incentives or constraints.",
