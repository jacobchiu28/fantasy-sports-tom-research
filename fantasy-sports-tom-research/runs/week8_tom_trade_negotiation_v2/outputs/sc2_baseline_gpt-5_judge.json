  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and mislabels Michael Roberts as a TE1 despite Tier 4 context. It doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s consensus-driven, targets/touches focus or zero-RB philosophy. While B might part with a backup TE, Kyle Mitchell (volatile Tier 4 WR) and Brian Scott (low-target TE) don\u2019t align with B\u2019s preferences. Trade is superficially feasible but mismatched to B\u2019s incentives and misreads player value, weakening consistency and explanation.",
