  "justification": "Offer unintentionally aligns with B\u2019s fondness for dual-threat QBs/injury buys (Adams, Robinson), but the rationale ignores B\u2019s urgent need for wins and their preferences. It mislabels Xavier Foster as a \u201chigh-upside starting TE\u201d despite being Out, and A already has a Tier 1 TE, making the need rationale wrong. The proposal is heavily A-centric, lacks clear multi-agent reasoning, and is internally inconsistent, leading to a poor Theory of Mind showing.",
