  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: they already have three Tier 1 QBs (including dual-threats), so a Tier 4 QB adds little. Offers a doubtful WR to an injury-averse manager. Asks for Devon Lewis, who fits B\u2019s young, healthy, ascending preference, making B less likely to part with him. Rationale is brief and ignores B\u2019s current roster strengths and injury stance, though the trade is structurally feasible.",
