  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s preferences: they value healthy, reliable workhorse RBs and possession WRs, making a swap of Ryan Taylor for a committee RB plus a doubtful, volatile WR misaligned. The rationale is A-centric and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives or roster needs, though the low p_accept hints at some awareness. The trade is feasible but unlikely given both teams need immediate, consistent production. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
