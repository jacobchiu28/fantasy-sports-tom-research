  "justification": "Proposal ignores B\u2019s preference for pocket passers/possession WRs and their tendency to buy injured players, not sell them. Asking B to trade a Tier 1 QB while thin at TE (and giving up Anderson) is unlikely. A, who avoids injury risk, is targeting a Doubtful TE despite already having a TE1, reducing fit. Rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address roster contexts, stacks, or schedules. Some minimal two-sided intent is present but poorly aligned.",
