  "justification": "B is risk-averse, needs immediate healthy production, and avoids injuries; offering an Out WR (Derek Harris) directly conflicts with B\u2019s preferences. Calling Harris a \u201cstable WR\u201d misreads his archetype and status. Asking B to give a Tier 1 RB plus two Tier 2 WRs for a Tier 5 RB and an injured asset is wildly imbalanced. The rationale is generic and ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven mindset and urgency. p_accept_B=0.62 is implausibly high.",
