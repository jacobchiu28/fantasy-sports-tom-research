  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s preference for stability and pocket passers and cites playoff schedule, but overlooks B\u2019s urgent need for wins, zero-RB lean, and existing QB depth (Foster, Flores). Value skewed: Tier1 workhorse Taylor for a Tier2 committee RB plus a Tier4 QB is unlikely for a conservative 1-7 team. Claim that Tyler Miller raises B\u2019s floor is weak. Rationale is concise but shallow and misses key roster/context details.",
