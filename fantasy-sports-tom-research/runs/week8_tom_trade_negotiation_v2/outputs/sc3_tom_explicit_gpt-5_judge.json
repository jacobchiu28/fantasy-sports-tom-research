  "justification": "Good nod to B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs, rookies, and playoff schedule. However, it overlooks B\u2019s trust in consensus (trading a Tier 1 QB for Tier 2) and comfort with injury risk, reducing likelihood to move Harris. From A\u2019s side, acquiring a questionable QB conflicts with A\u2019s injury-averse profile and Ben King isn\u2019t a workhorse. Rationale is brief and lacks detail.",
