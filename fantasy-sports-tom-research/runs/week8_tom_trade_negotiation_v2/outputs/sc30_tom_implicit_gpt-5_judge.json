  "justification": "Good recognition that B needs RB depth and both managers follow consensus. Clearly frames benefits for each side. Lacks nuance on B\u2019s 0-8 urgency, B\u2019s WR surplus/TE depth specifics, and A\u2019s stylistic preferences. The trade is coherent and fits roster needs: B converts surplus WR1 and expendable TE4 into RB1+RB3; A upgrades to WR1 and a more receiving-oriented TE. Explanation is brief and generic.",
