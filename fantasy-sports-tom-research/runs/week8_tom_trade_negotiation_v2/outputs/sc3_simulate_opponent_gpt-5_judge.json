  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s interest in dual-threat QB, rookie upside, and playoff angle. However, ignores that B already has a Tier 1 QB (Cameron Harris) and shaky TE depth. For A, labeling Flores as \u201cTE stability\u201d conflicts with A\u2019s injury-avoidance and Flores\u2019s doubtful status; A also downgrades from a Tier 2 to Tier 4 QB, clashing with A\u2019s reliability preference. Reasoning is brief and lacks detail on each team\u2019s roster context.",
