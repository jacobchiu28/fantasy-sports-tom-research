  "justification": "Good attempt to frame B as upside-seeking and injury-friendly, but it misreads B\u2019s likely valuation of Cameron Scott (rookie, Tier 1, ascending, high ceiling) as merely low-variance and expendable. It only lightly addresses roster context and A\u2019s veteran/workhorse preferences. The trade is feasible but value logic is shaky: B downgrades from a Tier 1 WR to a Tier 5 while only modestly upgrading RB. Explanation is clear but not nuanced; p_accept appears overstated.",
