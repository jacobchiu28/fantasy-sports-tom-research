  "justification": "Good recognition of B\u2019s conservative floor-seeking and contrarian streak, plus WR depth and Taylor\u2019s volatility/tough playoff slate. However, it overlooks B\u2019s stated preference for possession receivers and high-powered offenses\u2014Anderson (Tier 5, outside, mid variance, not possession) doesn\u2019t fit. Trading B\u2019s Tier 1 workhorse (Taylor) for a Tier 5 workhorse (Robinson) contradicts zero-RB scarcity value. Reasoning distinguishes A vs B aims, but the offer is lopsided and rationale overstates Anderson\u2019s stability, reducing coherence.",
