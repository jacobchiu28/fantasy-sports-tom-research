  "justification": "Misreads Team B: calls Liam Wright and Alex Mitchell \u2018consistent\u2019 despite deep-threat WR and committee RB profiles. B needs immediate, reliable production and likely wouldn\u2019t downgrade from Josh Garcia (Tier 2 RB) to Mitchell (Tier 3). While B can spare a TE, giving up their best RB for another volatile WR clashes with their preferences. Rationale is brief and inaccurate, though the trade is mechanically feasible.",
