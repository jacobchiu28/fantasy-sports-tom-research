  "justification": "Ignores Team B\u2019s stated values: they prize workhorse RBs and possession WRs yet are asked to give them up for a dual-threat QB (they prefer pocket passers) and an injured deep-threat WR. B already has a Tier 1 QB, so Derek White adds little. Mason Mitchell\u2019s questionable status clashes with B\u2019s injury caution. Trade guts B\u2019s RB core and offers no stack benefit. Rationale is vague and mislabels \u2018stability\u2019; acceptance probability is unrealistic.",
