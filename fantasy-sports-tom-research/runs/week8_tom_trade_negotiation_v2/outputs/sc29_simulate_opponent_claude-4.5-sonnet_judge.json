  "justification": "Some nod to B\u2019s buy-low-on-injury tendency by including an injured TE, but it mislabels Justin Wright as high-upside and Josh Robinson as a \u201cstable RB1.\u201d Benefits to both sides are asserted without linking to B\u2019s stated preferences (deep threats, committee backs, urgent wins). The offer is feasible but internally inconsistent with player tiers/roles. Rationale is a one-liner lacking roster/context specifics.",
