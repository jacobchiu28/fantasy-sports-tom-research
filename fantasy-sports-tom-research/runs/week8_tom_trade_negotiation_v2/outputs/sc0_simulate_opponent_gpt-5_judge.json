  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s QB/TE surplus and A\u2019s desire for a steadier QB, but misses that B prefers possession WRs and pocket passers, and needs immediate floors (Eric Davis is doubtful, high variance). Calling Michael Roberts a floor TE is shaky. Trade is feasible, but handing B an injured boom/bust WR while taking their only pocket QB conflicts with B\u2019s stated preferences and urgency. Rationale is brief and generic.",
