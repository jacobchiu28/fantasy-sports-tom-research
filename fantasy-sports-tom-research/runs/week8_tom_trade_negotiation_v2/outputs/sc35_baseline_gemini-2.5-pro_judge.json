Little to no modeling of Team B\u2019s beliefs or incentives: B is contrarian, cautious on injuries, and would be giving up its best TE for another questionable QB. While the swap is plausible roster-wise, it weakens B\u2019s immediate TE spot despite urgent win needs. Rationale is brief and one-sided.",
