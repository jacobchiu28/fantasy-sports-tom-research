  "justification": "The offer incidentally fits some of Team B\u2019s tastes (dual-threat QB with minor injury risk, rookie WR) and leverages B\u2019s RB depth, but the rationale ignores B\u2019s motivations and needs. It mislabels Trevor Martin as a consistent WR despite a deep-threat profile. Separation of A vs. B incentives is minimal, and there\u2019s little explicit ToM about B\u2019s injury tolerance or QB situation. The trade is feasible but the reasoning is generic.",
