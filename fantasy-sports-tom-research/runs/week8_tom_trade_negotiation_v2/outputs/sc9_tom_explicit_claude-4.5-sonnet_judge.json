  "justification": "Shows ToM by noting B\u2019s floor needs and WR volatility, offering Sam Lewis as a stable RB and giving A ceiling with Ryan Taylor. But it misses B\u2019s preference for possession WRs (Mason Torres isn\u2019t one) and clashes with B\u2019s zero-RB mindset by asking them to swap a top workhorse RB for another RB. Value feels lopsided (Taylor > Lewis; Moore \u2265 Torres), so acceptance is unlikely. Rationale is concise but light on specifics.",
