  "justification": "Shows some ToM by pitching B on depth and friendly playoff schedules, but misreads B\u2019s needs: calling Ethan Turner a TE upgrade is incorrect given B\u2019s Darian Taylor (Tier 2). Ignores B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and consensus rankings. Trade is feasible and A\u2019s desire to consolidate into a workhorse fits, though Robinson\u2019s low-volume offense conflicts with A\u2019s high-powered offense preference. Rationale is brief and thin on evidence.",
