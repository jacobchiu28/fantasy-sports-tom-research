  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and ignores B\u2019s needs. Team B (1-7) values consistent, target-heavy options; Noah Brown fits that profile, while Darian Moore is a high-variance outside WR and Darian Taylor is a lateral TE move at best. B already has multiple TEs, so swapping their premium receiving TE for a similar-tier TE plus a boom-bust WR is misaligned. The offer is feasible but poorly tailored, with minimal evidence-based explanation.",
