  "justification": "Offer misreads Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-focused profile. Proposes a high-variance WR with declining role plus a mid-tier rookie RB (tough playoff slate) for B\u2019s steady Tier-2 RB with friendly schedule\u2014opposite of B\u2019s values and urgent win-now needs. Rationale is A-centric and generic, with little reference to B\u2019s preferences or expert-consensus tendencies. Mechanically coherent but strategically mismatched; 0.35 acceptance is optimistic.",
