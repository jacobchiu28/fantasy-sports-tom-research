  "justification": "Correctly notes B\u2019s RB scarcity and WR surplus and appeals to B\u2019s consensus-driven style. But it ignores B\u2019s fade of players in run-heavy contexts (possible for Kyle Garcia) and doesn\u2019t address urgency/bye timing. Little on A\u2019s motives. Also overstates Noah Taylor as \u201cstartable\u201d despite decline. Coherent but thin.",
