  "justification": "Proposal centers on A\u2019s needs, not B\u2019s. It overlooks B\u2019s preferences (consistency, veterans, pocket passers) and B\u2019s TE weakness. B already has a Tier 1 QB, reducing the appeal of a dual-threat QB; Anderson fits but may not justify losing RB depth. The 2-for-1 for a Tier 5 \u201cworkhorse\u201d only loosely supports A\u2019s stated stability goal. Rationale is brief and generic.",
