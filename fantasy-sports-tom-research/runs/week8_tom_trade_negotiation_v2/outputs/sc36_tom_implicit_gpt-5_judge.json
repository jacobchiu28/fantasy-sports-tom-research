  "justification": "Offers B an Out QB and Doubtful WR for B\u2019s healthy Tier 1 RB despite B needing wins now. While B likes ceiling and may buy injured players, the rationale wrongly claims help \u201cnow\u201d and ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven valuation of Xavier Carter. Limited separation of A vs B goals, no discussion of B\u2019s current QB depth or immediate production needs. Acceptance probability is inflated.",
