  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s playoff RB need but ignores key beliefs: B already has multiple Tier 1 QBs and values healthy, ascending players. Calling Tier 4 Ethan Torres a \u201csolid\u201d dual-threat mismatches B\u2019s standards, and Josh Garcia\u2019s declining role undercuts the \u2018upgrade\u2019 claim despite a friendly playoff schedule. The offer could fit B\u2019s QB surplus, but value is light for a Tier 1 Jake Green. Rationale is brief and generic, with limited two-sided reasoning.",
