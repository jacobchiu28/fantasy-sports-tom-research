  "justification": "B values young, ascending deep-threat WRs, chases ceiling, and is injury-cautious. Devon Martinez (Tier 2, ascending) fits B\u2019s priorities; swapping him for Austin Williams (Tier 5, questionable) contradicts B\u2019s beliefs. The RB swap (Robinson Tier 5 workhorse vs Wright Tier 5 committee) is largely lateral per consensus B trusts. Acceptance probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives, injuries, or playoff schedule beyond a label.",
