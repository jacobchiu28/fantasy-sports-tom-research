  "justification": "Identifies Team B\u2019s desire for stable WRs and injury caution, but mislabels Brandon Martinez as a possession WR and Ethan Turner as low-variance. Proposes B trade a Tier 1 RB (Rodriguez) despite B\u2019s conservative, consensus-trusting style that values workhorse RBs. TE upgrade is marginal given B\u2019s current TE4. The offer is imbalanced and inconsistent with B\u2019s priorities, so acceptance is unlikely despite the multi-player rationale.",
