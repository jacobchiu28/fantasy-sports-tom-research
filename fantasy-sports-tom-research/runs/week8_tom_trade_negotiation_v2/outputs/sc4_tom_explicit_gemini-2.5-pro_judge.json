  "justification": "Captures B\u2019s appetite for ceiling by swapping to a higher-variance RB, but ignores B\u2019s large WR downgrade (Tier 2 Austin Torres to Tier 5 Marcus Taylor) and B\u2019s rookie/stack preferences. A\u2019s stated desire for consistency/possession WRs isn\u2019t clearly met by Austin Torres. Value is lopsided toward A, making the 0.6 accept probability unrealistic. Rationale is brief and generic, lacking roster/usage/playoff-schedule specifics.",
