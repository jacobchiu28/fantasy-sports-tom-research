  "justification": "Captures basic style fit: B gets stable veteran RB floors and A gets an upside rookie WR. Shows some perspective-taking but lacks nuance about B\u2019s preference for true workhorse backs and heavy touches, and B\u2019s urgency for immediate weekly starters. The offer is roster-coherent (B\u2019s RB need, A\u2019s RB surplus), and health/risk profiles align with B\u2019s injury aversion. However, rationale is terse and generic, omitting player roles and usage specifics; p_accept seems somewhat optimistic given both RBs are committee pieces.",
