  "justification": "Rationale centers only on Team A\u2019s floor and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, stability-seeking mindset. It asks B to give up Campbell (low variance, possession traits) for Baker (high variance), which clashes with B\u2019s preferences and urgent need for reliable points. It also mislabels Turner as a TE upgrade over Adams (likely a downgrade for A). While B does receive a TE upgrade (Adams) and a buy\u2011low RB (White), these points aren\u2019t argued and don\u2019t clearly offset losing Campbell\u2019s stability.",
