  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s RB need but ignores A\u2019s preference for workhorse RBs and weekly floor; swapping Josh Martin for an injured TE conflicts with A\u2019s style. Calling Tyler Anderson a \u201cstable upgrade\u201d overlooks his Doubtful status and tough playoffs. Little engagement with B\u2019s upside/stack preferences or injury buy-low tendency (they\u2019d be selling the injured player). Offer is feasible but value and fit are off, and the rationale is generic rather than roster- and context-grounded.",
