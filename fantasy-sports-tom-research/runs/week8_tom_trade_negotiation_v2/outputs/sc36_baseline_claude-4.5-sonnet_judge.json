  "justification": "Rationale focuses on A\u2019s upgrade and TE depth but barely models B\u2019s mindset. It ignores B\u2019s risk-seeking style, reliance on expert consensus, and tendency to buy/hold injured stars\u2014making a trade away from an injured Tier 1 RB unlikely. It also overlooks B\u2019s urgent need for wins and specific incentives beyond a TE upgrade. Additionally, A\u2019s injury-averse profile conflicts with targeting a Questionable RB. While pieces are broadly realistic and roster-fit is plausible, the explanation is generic and not grounded in the scenario\u2019s details.",
