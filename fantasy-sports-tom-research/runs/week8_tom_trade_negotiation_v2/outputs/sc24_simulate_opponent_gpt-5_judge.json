  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they already have strong RB depth and prefer workhorse volume, making a committee Tier 3 RB unappealing. B\u2019s conservative, injury-averse approach plus a doubtful TE1 means trading away their healthy Tier 2 TE (Roberts) is unlikely. The rationale is generic and ignores B\u2019s TE dependence and RB surplus. Technically feasible and helps A\u2019s TE floor, but poorly aligned with B\u2019s incentives.",
