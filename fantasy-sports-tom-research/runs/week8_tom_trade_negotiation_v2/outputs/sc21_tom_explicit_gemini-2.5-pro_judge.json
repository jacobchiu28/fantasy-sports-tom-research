  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs and preferences: B is conservative, seeks stable possession WRs, and needs immediate wins, yet receives a doubtful RB (Alex White) and a volatile rookie WR (David Baker). Calling B\u2019s RB room \u201cawful\u201d is inaccurate (they have a Tier 2 and Tier 3 RB). The offer benefits A\u2019s floor preference by acquiring a low-variance veteran (David Campbell) but doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s mindset. Rationale is brief and not evidence-based.",
