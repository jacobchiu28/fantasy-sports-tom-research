  "justification": "Acknowledges B gains a workhorse and A gets a deep threat, but weak belief modeling: ignores B\u2019s solid RB depth, WR needs, and injury tolerance. Limited separation of incentives; doesn\u2019t weigh A\u2019s 7\u20131, playoff-minded, consensus-aligned approach (RB1 for WR4 is poor for A). Feasible and B might accept, but it\u2019s lopsided and misaligned with A\u2019s profile and playoff schedule considerations. Rationale is brief and lacks concrete roster, tier, and health context.",
