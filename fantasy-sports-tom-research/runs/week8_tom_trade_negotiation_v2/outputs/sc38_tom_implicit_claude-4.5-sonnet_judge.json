  "justification": "Proposal notes B\u2019s desire for big-play WRs and playoff schedules, but misses key beliefs: B trusts consensus and avoids injury risk, and would not gut RB depth. Trading Harris and Nelson leaves B with only Green (questionable) and Sam Reed at RB\u2014untenable for a 6\u20132, consensus-driven manager. Rationale is generic and frames B as ceiling-seeking, not balanced. A\u2019s floor-seeking also conflicts with A\u2019s ceiling-chasing style. Value is plausible, but ToM fit is weak.",
