  "justification": "Identifies that B would like RB depth and a possession WR, but ignores B\u2019s injury aversion and consensus mindset. Misreads A\u2019s priorities and urgency: A trades a healthy Tier 1 RB and Tier 2 WR for an Out, Tier 5 WR, contradicting A\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking style. Rationale wrongly calls Lucas Allen a steady-floor upgrade. The offer is wildly lopsided toward B and internally inconsistent with roles and health statuses. Explanation is brief but inaccurate.",
