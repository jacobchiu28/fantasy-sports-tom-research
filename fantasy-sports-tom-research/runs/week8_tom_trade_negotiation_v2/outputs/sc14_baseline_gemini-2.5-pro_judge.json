  "justification": "The offer focuses only on Team A\u2019s need at TE and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative mindset and incentives. Team B would be trading a reliable Tier 2 TE (a position of strength) for a volatile RB (Sean Holt) and a declining, high-variance veteran WR (Darian Moore), which conflicts with their floor-first, veteran-stability preferences. The trade is structurally feasible and addresses A\u2019s weakness, but the rationale is one-sided and thin, with little evidence of modeling B\u2019s beliefs or motivations.",
