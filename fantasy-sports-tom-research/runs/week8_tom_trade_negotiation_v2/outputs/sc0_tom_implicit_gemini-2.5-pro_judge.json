  "justification": "Assumes Team B \u201cdesperately needs\u201d an RB despite having Tier 1/2 RBs, and ignores B\u2019s preference for pocket passers/possession WRs and willingness to buy injured players. Asking for B\u2019s Tier 1 QB (Reed) plus a WR for A\u2019s Tier 5 workhorse is value-incoherent and unlikely given B\u2019s conservative style and win-now needs. It also contradicts Team A\u2019s preference for workhorse RBs by trading their only one. Rationale is generic and thin, lacking player-tier or role-based justification; 0.65 acceptance is unrealistic.",
