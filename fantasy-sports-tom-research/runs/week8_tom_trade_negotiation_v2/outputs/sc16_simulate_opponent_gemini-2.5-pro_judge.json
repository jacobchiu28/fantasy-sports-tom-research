  "justification": "B values healthy workhorse RBs and reliability; offering a Doubtful, high-variance WR plus a Tier 2 QB for B\u2019s Tier 1 workhorse ignores those preferences. While noting both teams need a shake-up, it fails to address B\u2019s injury caution and RB-centric priorities. B already has a Tier 1 QB, so Nelson isn\u2019t a clear need. The rationale is generic and mislabels the RB as merely high-volatility, making 0.55 acceptance unlikely.",
