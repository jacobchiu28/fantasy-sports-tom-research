  "justification": "It notes B values dual-threat QBs and offers B a TE upgrade, but ignores that B would lose its only healthy QB (Logan Clark is out), making the deal impractical for a win-now 0-8 team. It also overlooks B\u2019s stated preference for committee backs by sending a workhorse. Rationale is brief and generic, with an unrealistically high accept probability given the QB hole.",
