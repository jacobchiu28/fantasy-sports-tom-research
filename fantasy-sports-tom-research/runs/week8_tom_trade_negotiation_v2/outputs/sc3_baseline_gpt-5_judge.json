  "justification": "Trade hints B might like a Tier 1 TE buy-low, but doesn\u2019t explicitly model B\u2019s consensus-trusting, rookie-upside, and playoff-SOS focus (King is a young breakout with tough playoff slate; Walker has tough playoff matchups). A\u2019s rationale notes RB stability and TE playoff outlook, but acquiring another Doubtful TE conflicts with A\u2019s injury-averse profile. Internally coherent on volatility and schedule, yet weak on why B would surrender King. Explanation is brief and light on B\u2019s incentives.",
