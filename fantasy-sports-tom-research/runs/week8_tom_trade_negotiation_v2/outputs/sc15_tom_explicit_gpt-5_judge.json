  "justification": "Good read on Team B\u2019s risk-seeking profile and RB depth; Nick Torres (rookie, ascending Tier 1) fits B\u2019s tastes. However, it underserves Team A\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven approach: trading a Tier 1 WR plus a fringe WR for a Tier 3 RB with a declining role and tough playoff slate is inconsistent with A\u2019s floor/workhorse preference. Rationale is brief and lacks role/schedule context. Coherent for B, but questionable for A\u2019s needs and philosophy.",
