  "justification": "Purely A-centric and misreads B\u2019s incentives. B is cautious on injuries and likely keeps their only healthy, ascending TE (Taylor). Asking for Alex White (doubtful) contradicts A\u2019s injury-avoidant profile and urgent win needs. Claiming Alex White > James Holt ignores tiers (T2 vs T1) and health. A already has a better TE than Taylor, making the \u2018upgrade\u2019 rationale incorrect. Minimal, inaccurate explanation.",
