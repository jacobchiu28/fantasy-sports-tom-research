  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and generic, with no clear modeling of B\u2019s upside/rookie preferences or willingness to move a young ascending RB. It asks B to trade away Darian Campbell (fits B\u2019s profile) for a veteran pocket QB (misaligned with B\u2019s stated QB preference). It also mislabels TE as an upgrade: Liam Adams (Tier 4, declining) is a downgrade from A\u2019s Tier 3 TE. Trade is feasible but internally inconsistent with profiles and poorly justified.",
