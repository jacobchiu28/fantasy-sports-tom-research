  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s desire for floor/volume, but misses key nuances: B prefers proven veterans, possession WRs, and workhorse RBs; Alex White is a doubtful committee back, not ideal for urgent wins. Calling James Rivera a playoff-upside add contradicts his tough playoff slate. The proposal does consider A\u2019s and B\u2019s aims, but superficially. Value and role fit are inconsistent (A overpays; B gains), and the rationale is brief and partially inaccurate.",
