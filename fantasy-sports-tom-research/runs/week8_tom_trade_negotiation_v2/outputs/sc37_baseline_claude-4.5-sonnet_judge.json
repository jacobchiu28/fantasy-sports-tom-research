  "justification": "Team B is conservative and values volume and stable floors, especially workhorse RBs. Asking for Ryan Taylor (Tier 1 workhorse) in exchange for two boom-bust deep-threat WRs ignores B\u2019s stated preferences and consensus-trusting style. Including Lucas Carter (Out) fits A\u2019s injury-buying approach but doesn\u2019t offset the RB loss for B. The rationale is generic and centered on A\u2019s needs, with minimal reasoning about B\u2019s incentives. Low acceptance probability is noted but unexplained.",
