Calling Lewis a \u201csurplus QB\u201d is incorrect\u2014A would have no healthy QB after the trade, conflicting with A\u2019s conservative style and urgent need to win. B might consider the deal for QB help, but the rationale doesn\u2019t articulate that. The explanation is terse and not grounded in roster context, injuries, or archetypes.",
