  "justification": "Massively lopsided toward Team B (Tier 1 RB + Tier 2 WR for Tier 4 TE + Tier 3 RB). Claiming A \u201cupgrades TE\u201d is incorrect (A\u2019s TE is Tier 3). Little engagement with B\u2019s zero-RB, consensus-driven, targets/touches mindset, though it loosely matches B\u2019s preference for healthy deep threats. p_accept_B is understated; B would likely snap-accept. Minimal, generic rationale and weak multi-agent reasoning.",
