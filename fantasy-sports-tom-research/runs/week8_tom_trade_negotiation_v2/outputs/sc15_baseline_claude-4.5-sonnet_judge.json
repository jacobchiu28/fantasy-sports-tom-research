  "justification": "Offer hints at B\u2019s ceiling preference by sending Eric Torres, but ignores B\u2019s strong bias toward rookies by asking for Cameron Scott (Tier 1 rookie, ascending). Little evidence of modeling B\u2019s beliefs beyond a low p_accept. Trade is structurally coherent and fits A\u2019s floor-seeking aims, though Ben King\u2019s declining role weakens A\u2019s urgent win-now need. Rationale is generic and sparse on player/roster context.",
