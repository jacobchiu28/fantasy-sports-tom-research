  "justification": "Team B prioritizes consistency and possession WRs and urgently needs weekly stability; trading away Caleb Foster (their reliable slot WR) for two high-variance WRs conflicts with their preferences. The rationale focuses on Team A\u2019s floor and mislabels Mason Mitchell as a lower-variance option. While the 2-for-2 WR swap is feasible, it\u2019s misaligned with B\u2019s incentives and A\u2019s stated goal (Mitchell isn\u2019t a floor play). Explanation is brief and not grounded in B\u2019s context.",
