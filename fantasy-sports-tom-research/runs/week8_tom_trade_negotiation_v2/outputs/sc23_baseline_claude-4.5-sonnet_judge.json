  "justification": "This offer downgrades A at RB (T2 Holt to Out T4 King) and is lateral at WR (T4 to T4), so the \u201cupgrade stability\u201d rationale is incorrect. It ignores B\u2019s incentives and needs (QB/TE injuries, upside leaning) and underestimates B\u2019s likely acceptance; B would probably accept more than 0.42. No clear ToM or separation of perspectives. Feasible but strategically incoherent for A and misaligned with both managers\u2019 stated preferences.",
