  "justification": "Recognizes B could use TE help and extra depth, but mislabels Noah Brown as a clear upgrade when B already has a healthy Tier 2 TE (Roberts). Overlooks B\u2019s preference for possession WRs by asking them to give up their only low-variance slot (Thomas). For A, acquiring a Questionable player contradicts their strict injury aversion and trading a Tier 2 TE plus a Tier 1 WR for a Tier 3 WR clashes with their consensus-trusting, conservative style. Rationale is brief and generic.",
