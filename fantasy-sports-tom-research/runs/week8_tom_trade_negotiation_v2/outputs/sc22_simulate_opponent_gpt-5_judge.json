  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s preference for steadier assets but overlooks key traits: B targets injured players as buys and follows consensus, making trading away a Tier 2 WR (Allen) for a Tier 3 RB (Campbell) plus a Tier 5 WR unlikely. Marcus Taylor\u2019s high variance also clashes with B\u2019s consistency bias. Fit is plausible (RB depth for B; upside WR for A) but value and psychology are off. Rationale is brief and lacks specifics; p_accept 0.72 is optimistic.",
