  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: they already have two Tier-2 dual-threat QBs, making Nelson redundant, while trading away RB2 Sean Holt depletes RB depth. Incorrectly labels Holt as injured and overstates QB volatility (Sam Foster is low variance). Assumes B will pivot to floor despite stated upside preference and playoff-schedule focus. For Team A, acquiring a high-volatility RB conflicts with a conservative, floor-focused profile. Reasoning is structured but factually inconsistent; acceptance probability is inflated.",
