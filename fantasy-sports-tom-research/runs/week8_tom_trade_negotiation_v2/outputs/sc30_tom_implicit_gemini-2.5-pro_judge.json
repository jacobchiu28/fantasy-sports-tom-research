  "justification": "Good read that B needs RB help and has TE depth; asks for a TE while sending a usable RB and WR. Separates A\u2019s playoff push (TE upgrade) from B\u2019s short-term need. However, it ignores B\u2019s tendency to fade low-volume offenses (Justin Young\u2019s context) and urgency specifics. Valuation is lopsided: A gives a Tier 2 WR and Tier 3 RB for a Tier 4 TE, a marginal upgrade that weakens A\u2019s WRs. Rationale is clear but thin on roster/tier detail.",
