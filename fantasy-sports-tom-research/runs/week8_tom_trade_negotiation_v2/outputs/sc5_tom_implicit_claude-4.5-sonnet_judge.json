  "justification": "B is conservative, values floor and workhorse RBs/possession WRs. This asks B to give up a Tier 1 workhorse (Ryan Taylor) for a Tier 5 workhorse (Josh Robinson) and another boom/bust deep-threat WR (Matt Wright) B doesn\u2019t need. Claiming \u201cstability\u201d contradicts the players\u2019 archetypes and tiers. It ignores B\u2019s surplus of volatile deep threats and lack of possession WRs. The offer is lopsided and unlikely; rationale is generic and not grounded in roster/context. P_accept is overstated.",
