  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs and deep threats, and Harris as an injury buy, but ignores B\u2019s urgent need for immediate points and that B already has a Tier-2 QB (Holt). Asking B to give up an active WR2 and RB depth for a lateral QB and an out WR is misaligned with their record. Feasible trade, but 0.72 accept is optimistic; rationale is too terse and lacks roster/role context.",
