  "justification": "Team B values workhorse RBs and possession WRs and avoids injuries; this asks them to give up their possession WR (Thomas) and RB depth (Reed) for a backup QB with a Q tag and a boom/bust WR\u2014misaligned with their preferences. Team A\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile also conflicts with acquiring two Q-tagged players. Value is lopsided (two Tier 3s for Tier 4 QB + Tier 4 WR). The rationale is brief, A-centric, and ignores B\u2019s incentives, making the 0.55 acceptance estimate unrealistic.",
