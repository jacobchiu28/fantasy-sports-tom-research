  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s desire to reduce variance but ignores that B prefers veterans and high-powered offenses; Robinson is a rookie in a low-volume offense. Overlooks TE scarcity for B by asking for their Tier 2 TE, leaving only a Tier 4 option. Separates A\u2019s and B\u2019s benefits, but reasoning is shallow and value-lopsided. The claim of variance reduction conflicts with Campbell\u2019s low volatility. Acceptance probability is unrealistically high.",
