  "justification": "Addresses Team A\u2019s TE weakness but ignores Team B\u2019s mindset. B is a ceiling-chasing risk-taker who values rookies; Cameron Gonzalez (Tier 2, young breakout) fits B\u2019s preferences and is their only strong TE. The return (Caleb Turner Tier 4 committee RB + Darian Anderson Tier 5 WR) lacks ceiling and leaves B thin at TE. Trade is feasible but unbalanced for B. Rationale is brief and A-centric with little B-focused reasoning.",
