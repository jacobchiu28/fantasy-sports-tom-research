  "justification": "Acknowledges B values possession/consistency and that B can spare a TE, but mislabels Derek Allen as consistent (he\u2019s high-variance) and adds another volatile deep threat (Sam Martin), clashing with B\u2019s risk-averse, win-now needs. A\u2019s ceiling-chasing profile also clashes with trading a deep threat for a lower-variance TE. Trade is feasible roster-wise, but the rationale is thin and ignores tiers, depth, and immediate-week impact. Overall ToM reasoning is superficial.",
