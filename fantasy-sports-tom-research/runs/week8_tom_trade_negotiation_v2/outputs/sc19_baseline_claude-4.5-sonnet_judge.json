  "justification": "Rationale only cites volatility for Team A and ignores Team B\u2019s beliefs (consensus rankings, rookies, SOS). Minimal perspective-taking; no clear reason why B would swap a rookie RB with friendly playoff schedule for an injured veteran WR throw-in. Trade is technically feasible but misaligned with A\u2019s conservative, workhorse preference and RB depth needs. Explanation is generic and not grounded in roster context.",
