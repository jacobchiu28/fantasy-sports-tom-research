  "justification": "B wants stable floors, workhorse touches, and avoids injury. Harris offers some floor but is still a committee back; Scott is volatile. B also values targets and would lose its only TE with a high target share (Noah Brown), creating a roster hole and lowering floor. A already has a healthy Tier 2 TE (Darian Taylor), so the \u2018weak TE\u2019 claim is dubious and the upgrade is lateral. The rationale is brief and ignores roster construction, bye/usage details, and B\u2019s conservative priorities.",
