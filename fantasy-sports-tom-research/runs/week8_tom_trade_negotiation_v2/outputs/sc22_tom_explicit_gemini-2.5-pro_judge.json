  "justification": "Recognizes B\u2019s WR depth and desire for consistency and offers a low-volatility RB. But it misreads key beliefs: B trusts consensus and values workhorse RBs and possession targets; swapping a Tier 1 WR (Sean) for a committee RB (Tier 3) and a Tier 4 WR is unlikely. Mason isn\u2019t a possession/steady archetype, and neither player is in clearly high-powered situations. The 0.65 acceptance is unrealistic. Reasoning nods to B\u2019s mindset but lacks nuance and value realism.",
