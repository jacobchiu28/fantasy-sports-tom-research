  "justification": "Fails to model B\u2019s consensus-driven, rookie/upside preferences; asks B to give up a Tier 2 breakout WR with a friendly playoff slate for a Tier 3 Q-tag possession WR and a worse RB. Minimal separation of A vs. B incentives and ignores B\u2019s playoff-schedule focus (which favors keeping Torres). Trade value is lopsided and p_accept is overstated. Rationale is generic and not grounded in tiers, roles, or injury context.",
