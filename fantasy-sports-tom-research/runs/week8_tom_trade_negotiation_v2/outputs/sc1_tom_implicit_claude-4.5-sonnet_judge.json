  "justification": "B is conservative and consensus-driven; unlikely to give up a Tier 3 RB with low volatility and a Tier 2 WR for a Tier 5 backup QB and a lower-tier, committee RB with a Q tag. B already has a Tier 1 QB, so Roberts adds little. King matches B\u2019s preferences; Torres doesn\u2019t. Holt\u2019s volatility might make him movable, but not for this downgrade. Rationale is generic and overstates fit; acceptance odds are too high.",
