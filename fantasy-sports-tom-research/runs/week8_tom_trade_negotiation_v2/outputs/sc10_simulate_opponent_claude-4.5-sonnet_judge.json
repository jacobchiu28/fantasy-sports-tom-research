  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: a 1-7, conservative, volume-first manager is unlikely to trade a Tier 1 RB (Justin Garcia) and a veteran WR for a mid-variance WR (Torres) and an OUT TE. Torres is mislabeled as a low-volatility possession WR, and injured TE depth doesn\u2019t help urgent wins. The offer is value-imbalanced and the high accept probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic, not grounded in roles, injuries, or Team B\u2019s contrarian profile.",
