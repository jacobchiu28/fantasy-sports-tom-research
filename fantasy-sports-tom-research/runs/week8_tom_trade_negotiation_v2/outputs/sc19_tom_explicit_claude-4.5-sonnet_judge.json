  "justification": "Shows some awareness of B\u2019s taste for upside and rookies, but misreads key priorities: B values strength of schedule and consensus, making Josh Garcia (friendly playoff slate) hard to trade for an injured Matt Hill. Claims Isaiah Adams is a TE upgrade are incorrect (B already has Tier 1/2 TEs). For A, acquiring rookies and a deep-threat WR conflicts with their floor-first, conservative style. Rationale contradicts itself (\u201cstable vets\u201d) and overestimates B\u2019s acceptance.",
