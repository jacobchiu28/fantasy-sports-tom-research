  "justification": "Recognizes B would value workhorse touches, but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB approach and emphasis on target volume; trading away Devon Lewis and a target-earning TE runs counter. A\u2019s \u201cTE upgrade\u201d is incorrect (Tier 4 Michael Roberts vs A\u2019s Tier 3 Brian Scott), and A loses a Tier 1 workhorse RB, so \u201cretains RB depth\u201d is false. Feasible but heavily favors B; reasoning is brief and thin on roster/tier context.",
