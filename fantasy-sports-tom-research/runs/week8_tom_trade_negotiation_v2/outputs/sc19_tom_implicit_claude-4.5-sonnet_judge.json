  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s likely high valuation of Josh Garcia (rookie, upside, friendly playoff schedule) and their consensus-trusting style. Offering Austin Wright (Tier 5) and a middling TE won\u2019t match B\u2019s priorities. It also clashes with Team A\u2019s conservative, floor-oriented approach by targeting a volatile committee rookie. Explanation is vague and doesn\u2019t distinguish A\u2019s needs from B\u2019s incentives. Trade is structurally feasible but value and motivation fit are poor.",
