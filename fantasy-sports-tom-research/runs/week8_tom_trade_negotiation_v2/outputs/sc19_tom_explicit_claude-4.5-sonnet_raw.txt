**Reasoning about Team B's Manager:**

Team B's manager values:
- **Committee backs with upside**: Josh Garcia is a mid-volatility rookie RB with friendly playoff schedule - exactly what B likes, but Matt Hill is a young breakout committee back that fits B's preference for upside plays
- **Rookies with breakout potential**: Kyle Martinez is a mid-volatility rookie WR, but B already has multiple rookies. Matt Hill as a young breakout offers similar appeal
- **Trusts expert consensus**: This trade offers positional diversification that experts typically recommend
- **Willing to roster injured players for upside**: B has risk tolerance
- **Strength of schedule focus**: Josh Garcia has friendly playoff schedule, but Matt Hill has mixed outlook (acceptable trade-off for youth/upside)

Team B likely perceives this as fair because:
1. They're getting a young breakout RB (Matt Hill) to add to their committee back collection
2. Isaiah Adams is a low-volatility veteran TE upgrade over Adam Allen (blocking TE)
3. They're giving up a rookie RB and rookie WR, but getting younger upside at RB plus TE stability
4. The trade aligns with their balanced approach and willingness to mix floors with upside

Team A benefits by:
1. Acquiring Josh Garcia (rookie RB, friendly playoff schedule, mid-volatility) - more stable than current committee backs
2. Kyle Martinez (rookie WR, mid-volatility) - less volatile than current high-variance WR corps
3. Moving Matt Hill and Isaiah Adams consolidates into younger, ascending players A prefers
