  "justification": "Correctly targets B\u2019s desire for floor with healthy, low-volatility RBs and gives A boom/bust WRs, but misses B\u2019s preference for true workhorse backs. Trade is lopsided toward B (A gives a Tier 1 and Tier 2 RB for a Tier 2 WR and a declining Tier 5 WR), making the 0.42 accept probability unrealistically low. Explanation is concise but generic, lacking specifics on roles, tiers, injuries, and B\u2019s urgent need for immediate RB touches.",
