  "justification": "A\u2019s ask fits its own goals (workhorse RB for playoffs) but doesn\u2019t model B\u2019s mindset. B prefers stable floors, possession WRs, and injured buy-lows; Allen is a high-variance deep threat and Caleb Turner is a committee back, so the package misaligns with B\u2019s preferences. The proposal ignores B\u2019s SoS/OL focus and consensus-driven approach. The trade itself is feasible and coherent, but the rationale is brief and A-centric, offering little evidence B would accept.",
