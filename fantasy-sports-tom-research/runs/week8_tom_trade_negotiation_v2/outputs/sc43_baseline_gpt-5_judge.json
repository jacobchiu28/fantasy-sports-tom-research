  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s conservative preferences: it asks B to downgrade from a Tier 2 dual-threat QB to a Tier 3 pocket QB and swap away their steadier WR (Torres) for a high-variance deep threat (E. Jones), which B dislikes. Rationale is A-centric and brief, with no appeal to B\u2019s values (workhorse RBs, stability). Trade is feasible but lopsided; p_accept_B is overstated.",
