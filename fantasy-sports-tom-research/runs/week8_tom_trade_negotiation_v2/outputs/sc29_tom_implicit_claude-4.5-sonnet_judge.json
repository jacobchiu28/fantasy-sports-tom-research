  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s incentives: calls Justin Wright a TE upgrade despite being Tier 5 and out. Minimal use of B\u2019s stated preferences (deep-threats, injured buy-lows) beyond vague \u2018young WR upside\u2019; doesn\u2019t note B\u2019s urgent need for wins or that Eric Davis is doubtful. Trade also ignores Team A\u2019s glaring TE need while adding a low-tier RB they don\u2019t need. Feasible but strategically incoherent. Rationale is generic and partially incorrect.",
