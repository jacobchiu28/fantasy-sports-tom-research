  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s appetite for upside/injured buys and committee RBs, but ignores B\u2019s playoff-schedule emphasis when giving up Isaiah (friendly playoffs). The offer is an overpay by A (Tier 1 RB + WR for a Tier 2 WR) and undermines A\u2019s urgent win-now needs and injury caution. Perspective-taking is present but shallow and not roster-specific (e.g., B\u2019s QB/TE issues). Rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t justify acceptance odds.",
