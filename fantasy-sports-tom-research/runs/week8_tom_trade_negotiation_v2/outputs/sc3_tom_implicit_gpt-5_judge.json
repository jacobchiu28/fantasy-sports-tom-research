  "justification": "Good read that B values a dual-threat QB for a friendly playoff slate. However, A would be left without a healthy QB and is taking back a doubtful TE, violating A\u2019s strict injury avoidance. Ben King is a committee RB with tough playoff matchups, not A\u2019s preferred workhorse profile. Rationale is brief and misses key roster/health constraints and B\u2019s comfort buying injured players.",
