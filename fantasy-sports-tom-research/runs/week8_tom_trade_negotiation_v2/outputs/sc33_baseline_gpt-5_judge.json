  "justification": "The offer ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven mindset. B would not trade a Tier 1, high-floor TE (Logan Mitchell, friendly playoff slate) for a questionable Tier 4 TE and a volatile deep-threat WR, which contradicts their preference for stability and possession types. The proposal serves Team A\u2019s needs but gives B less stability. The rationale is generic and does not reference either team\u2019s context or values, undermining credibility.",
