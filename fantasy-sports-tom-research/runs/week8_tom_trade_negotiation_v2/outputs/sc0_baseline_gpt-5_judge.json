  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and ignores B\u2019s preferences (possession WRs, pocket passers) and needs (TE depth is thin; trading Anderson is unlikely). Offering injured Alex White incidentally fits B\u2019s injury-buying, but this isn\u2019t argued. For A, acquiring a Doubtful TE clashes with A\u2019s strict injury avoidance and is redundant with an existing Tier 1 TE; trade doesn\u2019t address A\u2019s RB need or stacking preference. Proposal is plausible but misaligned with both managers\u2019 profiles.",
