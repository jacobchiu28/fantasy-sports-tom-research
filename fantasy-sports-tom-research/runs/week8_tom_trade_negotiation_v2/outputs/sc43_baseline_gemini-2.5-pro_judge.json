  "justification": "The proposal focuses on Team A\u2019s needs and ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-first preferences. Asking for Austin Torres (ascending, friendly schedule) in exchange for Jordan King (committee, declining role, tough playoffs) likely reduces B\u2019s weekly stability. B already rosters volatile committee RBs; adding another doesn\u2019t fit their beliefs. The offer is feasible roster-wise (A trades RB depth for WR), but the rationale is generic and lacks evidence about B\u2019s incentives or rankings.",
