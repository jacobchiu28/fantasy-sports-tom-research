  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s taste for dual-threat QBs and deep-threat WRs, offering Derek White and a rookie burner. However, it overlooks B\u2019s 6-2 contender status and the high opportunity cost of surrendering their Tier 1 RB (Noah Carter). The rationale is terse and doesn\u2019t weigh B\u2019s RB depth, QB needs, or contrarian tendencies beyond labels. The trade is feasible and two-sided, but value is lopsided toward A and the explanation lacks concrete, scenario-grounded details.",
