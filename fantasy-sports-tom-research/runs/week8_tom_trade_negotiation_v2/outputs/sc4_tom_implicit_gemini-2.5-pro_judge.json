  "justification": "Mentions B\u2019s desire for upside but ignores specific preferences (rookies, injury buy-low, stacks) and B\u2019s tendency to fade run-heavy offenses. Separates motivations superficially (A wants consistency, B wants ceiling) but misses A\u2019s injury aversion when asking for Q Josh Martin and A\u2019s preference for possession WRs (Torres isn\u2019t). The swap is feasible and partly aligns with A\u2019s schedule concerns and B\u2019s upside chase, yet the rationale is generic and not grounded in roster/context details.",
