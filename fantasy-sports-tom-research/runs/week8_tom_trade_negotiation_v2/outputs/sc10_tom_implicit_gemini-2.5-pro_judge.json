  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s desire for stability but overlooks key beliefs: B prioritizes workhorse RB volume and immediate wins. Alex White is a committee back and doubtful, not a reliable floor, and B already has RB depth while needing WR stability. Trading a Tier 1, high-variance WR for Torres plus an injured RB mismatches B\u2019s incentives. Calling them \u201creliable weekly starters\u201d contradicts roles/health. Rationale is brief and lacks specific usage/injury context.",
