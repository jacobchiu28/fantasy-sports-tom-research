  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they need wins and floor/volume, yet the offer is an injured WR labeled as \u201cstable\u201d for B\u2019s Tier 1 RB. Ignores B\u2019s RB scarcity and WR depth and B\u2019s preference for reliable possession targets. Minimal, generic rationale with incorrect characterization of Harris; no schedule, role, or OL context. Overestimates acceptance probability. Slight nod to A\u2019s style (chasing volatile RB upside), but overall ToM and coherence are poor.",
