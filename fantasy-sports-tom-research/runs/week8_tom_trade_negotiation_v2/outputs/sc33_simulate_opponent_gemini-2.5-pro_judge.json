  "justification": "Shows some awareness that B might like a low-volatility RB, but overlooks B\u2019s conservative preference against uncertain injured assets (Ben Miller is Out, declining). Mislabels Darian Anderson as a \u2018needed starter\u2019 for A despite Tier 5 status. Reasoning mentions both sides but is generic and not tied to B\u2019s stated tastes (possession WRs, proven vets) or roster depth. Trade is feasible and value roughly coherent, yet the ToM rationale is shallow.",
