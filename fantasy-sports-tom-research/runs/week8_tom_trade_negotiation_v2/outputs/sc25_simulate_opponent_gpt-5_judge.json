  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s desire for dual-threat QB and WR surplus, but overlooks key factors: Jake Green and B\u2019s QB share the same bye (Week 10), A\u2019s injury-cautious approach conflicts with acquiring a Questionable WR, and A would lose their only healthy elite dual-threat QB during a playoff push. Rationale is brief and lacks detail on value, roles, and team philosophies (e.g., B\u2019s zero-RB WR depth preservation). Coherence and ToM are only moderate.",
