  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they prefer dual-threat upside and already have Sam Foster (Tier 2, rookie dual-threat). Calling Ethan Turner a TE upgrade is wrong vs B\u2019s Tier 2 Brian Hill; Turner is Tier 4. A already has a low-variance Tier 2 QB (David Nelson), so the stated benefit is redundant. Minimal, generic rationale and poor alignment with B\u2019s urgent, upside-seeking needs make acceptance unlikely.",
