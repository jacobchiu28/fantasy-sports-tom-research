However, it ignores Team A\u2019s stated injury avoidance by asking A to take an injured TE, and the value is wildly lopsided against A (losing Tier 1 RB and TE for Tier 4 RB and injured TE). Rationale is terse and misses roster/role context and A\u2019s incentives, making acceptance probability and overall coherence dubious.",
