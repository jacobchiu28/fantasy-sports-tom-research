  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s interest in a dual-threat QB and RB depth, but ignores B\u2019s zero-RB and injured-player buying tendencies. Perspective-taking is shallow and mixes viewpoints (\u201cwe fix TE\u201d) while A already has a Tier 1 TE. The trade is highly lopsided (A gives elite QB and RB for a mid WR and low-end TE), and p_accept is understated for B. Rationale is terse and not grounded in roster context or playoff outlooks.",
