B values stable floors and possession WRs; Caleb Foster (Tier 2 possession) fits that, while Rivera (deep-threat, volatile) and Wright (Tier 5 committee) don\u2019t. The offer downgrades B\u2019s lineup and contradicts their consensus-driven, risk-averse profile. Rationale is thin and acceptance probability is overstated.",
