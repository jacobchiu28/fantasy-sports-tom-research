  "justification": "Minimal ToM: it doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s upside bias, dual-threat QB/stack preference, or buy-low injury stance. Perspective-taking is shallow (only notes B \u2018upgrades RB\u2019). Consistency issues: calling Tyler Anderson a stabilizing TE for conservative A despite being doubtful is dubious; \u2018RB depth maintained\u2019 for A is inaccurate after losing a Tier 1 workhorse. Trade is somewhat feasible (B gets RB help, has other TEs) but the value and rationale are thin and not grounded in the profiles.",
