  "justification": "Correctly targets Team B\u2019s acute RB shortage and offers two Tier 3 committee backs, while requesting a TE from B\u2019s surplus (Roberts is a Tier 4 among multiple TEs). Distinguishes A\u2019s goal (TE upgrade) from B\u2019s needs (immediate RB help for 0-8 team). Trade is roster- and role-coherent with no injury/bye conflicts. Rationale is concise but omits deeper cues (B\u2019s TE depth, urgency for immediate starters, consensus valuation), limiting explanation depth.",
