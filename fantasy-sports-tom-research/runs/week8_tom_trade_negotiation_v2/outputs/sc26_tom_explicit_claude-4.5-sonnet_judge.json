  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s RB need but ignores B\u2019s stated love of dual-threat QBs and comfort stashing injured players\u2014selling Clark and Anderson contradicts that. Overlooks TE scarcity/value for B. From A\u2019s side, dealing a Tier 1 workhorse RB for two injured assets clashes with A\u2019s conservative, floor-first style and existing solid QB (Sam Martinez). Roster impacts (A\u2019s RB depth) are underexplained, and the acceptance probability seems optimistic. Rationale is brief and lacks injury timeline and preference-driven nuance.",
