  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s mindset: a 3-5, ceiling-chasing, consensus-trusting manager is unlikely to trade a Tier 1 workhorse (Josh Martin) for a Tier 3 committee RB and a Tier 4 TE. B also targets injured players as buy-lows, not sell-highs. Additionally, Team A\u2019s stated avoidance of injury concerns clashes with acquiring a Questionable RB. Rationale only covers A\u2019s needs and lacks evidence-based reasoning for B\u2019s acceptance.",
