  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s conservative, veteran-preferring mindset by offering higher-variance assets for their stable RB. Claims A gets a low-variance WR, but Trevor Martin is a mid-variance deep threat. Minimal use of roster/tier context and injuries beyond a vague \u2018stability vs upside\u2019 frame. Trade is feasible, and B does gain a WR upgrade (Isaiah Thompson), but value and psychology alignment are off. Rationale is shallow and partially inaccurate.",
