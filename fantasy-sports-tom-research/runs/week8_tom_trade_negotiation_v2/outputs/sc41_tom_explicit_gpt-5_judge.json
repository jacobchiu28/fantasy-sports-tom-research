  "justification": "Sending Flores addresses B\u2019s QB hole, but labeling Lucas (Out, Tier 5) as a reliable vet misreads B\u2019s need for healthy, consistent contributors and possession profiles. Requesting Malik (productive deep threat) plus a TE while offering an injured WR is unbalanced. TE piece is expendable for B, but overall fit and fairness are weak. The rationale is generic and omits key context (B\u2019s QB vacancy, B\u2019s consistency preference), making the 0.55 acceptance estimate optimistic.",
