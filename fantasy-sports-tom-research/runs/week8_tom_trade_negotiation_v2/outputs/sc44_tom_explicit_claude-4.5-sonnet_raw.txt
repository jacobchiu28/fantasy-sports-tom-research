  "offer_from_A": ["Josh Robinson", "James Jones"],
  "ask_from_B": ["Kyle Garcia", "Austin Torres", "Chris Reed"],
  "rationale": "Workhorse RB + stable QB for committee backs. B gets floor, A gets depth. Both conservative managers satisfied.",
  "p_accept_B": 0.72,
  "perspective_taking_analysis": {
    "team_b_needs": "Team B is 3-5 and desperate for wins. They need consistent weekly floors to climb back into playoff contention. Their RB situation is weak with only committee backs (Nick Turner high volatility, Kyle Garcia low volatility, Malik Moore committee). They have QB depth with both Devon Green and Chris Reed.",
    "team_b_psychology": "Manager B is extremely conservative, trusts expert consensus, avoids injury risk, and values proven veterans with stable floors. They need reliability NOW given their 3-5 record. Josh Robinson is a workhorse RB (exactly what B values) with friendly playoff schedule and mid volatility - much better than their committee backs. James Jones provides low volatility dual-threat value as insurance.",
    "team_b_perception_of_fairness": "B would see this as getting the clear best asset (workhorse RB Robinson) which consensus would favor. They're giving up depth pieces (Kyle Garcia is just a committee back, Austin Torres is a young WR, Chris Reed is their backup QB). The 2-for-3 quantity favors them. Robinson's rookie status might concern them slightly, but his workhorse role and friendly playoff schedule override this.",
    "team_a_rationale": "Manager A is contrarian and targets high-powered offenses. They're 5-3 and can afford to trade their workhorse RB for depth. Kyle Garcia provides the stable floor A values (low volatility veteran). Austin Torres gives them another WR with friendly playoff schedule. Chris Reed is a stable backup QB. A is being contrarian by trading away the 'consensus better' side while gaining multiple pieces with playoff-friendly schedules."
