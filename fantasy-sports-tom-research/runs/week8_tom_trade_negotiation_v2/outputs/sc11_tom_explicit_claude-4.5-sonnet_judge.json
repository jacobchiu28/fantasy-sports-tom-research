  "justification": "Good identification of Team B\u2019s need for consistency and QB surplus, and that a possession WR could help them. However, it underweights B\u2019s stated preference for workhorse RBs and immediate win equity, overlooks B\u2019s glaring TE weakness, and ignores that B already has a possession WR (Caleb Foster). A Tier 3 WR for a Tier 2 RB is value-light for B; 0.72 accept probability is unrealistic. Reasoning is clear but misapplies playoff schedule importance to a 0-8 team.",
