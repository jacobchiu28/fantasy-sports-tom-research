  "justification": "Misreads Team B: a conservative, zero-RB manager is unlikely to trade away a Tier 1 workhorse (Ryan Taylor) and a Tier 2 WR for two Tier 5 pieces. Calling Robinson \u201cstable\u201d and Anderson \u201cconsistent\u201d contradicts their profiles. Minimal evidence of B\u2019s motives beyond a vague \u2018contrarian\u2019 note; no discussion of rosters, tiers, or playoff context. The offer is lopsided and unrealistic, so acceptance probability is overstated.",
