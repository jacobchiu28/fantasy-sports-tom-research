  "justification": "Fails to model B: they value rookies and zero-RB/injury buys; asking for Cameron Scott (Tier 1 rookie) conflicts, while Adams is a weak injured buy. Green (Tier 1 dual-threat) might appeal, but the rationale never references B\u2019s incentives or consensus lean. Claim that \u201cTurner starts\u201d ignores A already has a Tier 1 TE. The QB-for-WR framework is plausible, but the reasoning is shallow and misaligned.",
