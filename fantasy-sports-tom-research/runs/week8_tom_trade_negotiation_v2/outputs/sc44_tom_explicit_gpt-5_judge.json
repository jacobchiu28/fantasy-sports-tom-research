  "justification": "Acknowledges B trusts rankings, but ignores B\u2019s strong injury aversion and urgency. Offers an OUT WR (Harris) while calling the deal injury-free\u2014contradictory and misaligned with B\u2019s risk profile. B also prefers pocket passers and already has a Tier 1 QB, reducing need for James Jones. Rationale is terse and factually off (Harris not a steady, available vet). Trade construction doesn\u2019t fit B\u2019s needs for immediate, healthy production.",
