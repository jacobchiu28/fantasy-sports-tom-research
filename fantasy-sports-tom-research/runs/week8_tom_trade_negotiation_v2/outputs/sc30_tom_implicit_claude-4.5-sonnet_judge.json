  "justification": "The proposal notes B gains RB depth, fitting B\u2019s glaring RB shortage and need for immediate starters. However, it barely models B\u2019s mindset (0-8 urgency, consensus-driven) and downplays the cost of losing a Tier 1 WR (Thompson) for a Tier 2 plus RB3; the TE \u201cupgrade\u201d to A is marginal. Perspectives aren\u2019t clearly separated and the reasoning is terse. The offer is roster-coherent given B\u2019s WR surplus and TE depth, but acceptance probability seems optimistic without adding value from A.",
