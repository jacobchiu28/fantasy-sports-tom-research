**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B is 0-8 and desperate for wins NOW, not playoff preparation. Their manager values:
- Workhorse RBs (but has only committee backs)
- QB-WR stacks (currently has Tyler Miller/Sam Martinez but no stacked WRs)
- Consistency over variance
- Established talent over hype

Team B would perceive value in:
1. **Ethan Torres (QB)**: Mid-volatility dual-threat veteran with more upside than their pocket passers, creates immediate stack opportunity
2. **Austin Torres (WR)**: Mid-volatility outside WR with friendly playoff schedule - provides the stack partner and consistent target share

What Team B gives up:
- **Sam Lewis (RB)**: Low-volatility committee back - their most consistent RB but not a workhorse anyway
- **Nick Torres (WR)**: Mid-volatility possession/deep threat - redundant depth given their WR surplus

Team B likely sees this as acquiring a QB upgrade with immediate stack synergy (Torres-Torres) while only sacrificing depth pieces. The 0-8 record means they need upside NOW, and the QB-WR stack offers weekly correlation that could generate wins.

From Team A's perspective: Acquiring the low-volatility RB (Sam Lewis) aligns with conservative playoff preparation, and Nick Torres adds possession receiver traits preferred by Manager A.
