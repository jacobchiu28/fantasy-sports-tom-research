  "justification": "Shows some ToM by targeting B\u2019s desire for a stable RB and offloading a boom WR, but overlooks B\u2019s zero-RB strategy and preference for possession WRs. Claims A upgrades TE despite Justin Wright being injured Tier 5 and A already having a Tier 1 TE. Value is lopsided (Tier 2 WR + negligible TE for a Tier 5 RB), so B\u2019s acceptance is overestimated. Reasoning is brief and misses key context.",
