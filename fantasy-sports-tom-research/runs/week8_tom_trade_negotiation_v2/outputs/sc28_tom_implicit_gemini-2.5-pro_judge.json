  "justification": "B is conservative and needs immediate floor at RB; trading away their only Tier 1 RB (Alex Thompson) for an injured WR (Derek Harris) and a TE is misaligned. B already has a Tier 1 TE (Alex Thomas), so \u2018TE upgrade\u2019 is incorrect. The offer leaves B\u2019s RB room thin (only Ben King healthy), hurting short-term wins. Rationale is brief and factually off, and the acceptance probability is overly optimistic.",
