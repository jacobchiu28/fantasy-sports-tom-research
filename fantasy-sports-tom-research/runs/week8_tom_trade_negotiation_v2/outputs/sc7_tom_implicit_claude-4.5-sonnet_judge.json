  "justification": "Rationale misreads Team B\u2019s preferences by asking for their dual-threat QB and rookie upside while offering floor players, despite B valuing upside. Minimal separation of A vs. B motives. Trade is feasible (B has QB depth and could use a WR upgrade), but it conflicts with Team A\u2019s conservative style and sacrifices a Tier 2 possession WR. Explanation is generic and lacks roster/context details.",
