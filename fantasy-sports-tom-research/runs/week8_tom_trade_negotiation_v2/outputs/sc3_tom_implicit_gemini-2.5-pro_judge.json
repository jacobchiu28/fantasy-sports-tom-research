  "justification": "It notes B likes dual-threat QBs but ignores that B trusts consensus (keeping a Tier 1 QB) and favors rookies/SOS. It also overlooks A\u2019s strict injury avoidance by asking A to accept a Questionable QB. The trade is imbalanced (B giving Tier 1 QB + RB for Tier 2 QB + WR4) and the 0.65 acceptance is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and lacks evidence on tiers, roles, and injuries.",
