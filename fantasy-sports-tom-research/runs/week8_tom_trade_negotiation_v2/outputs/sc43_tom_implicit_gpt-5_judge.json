B would be downgrading from a Tier 1 RB and Tier 2 QB to a Tier 5 RB and Tier 3 QB while needing wins\u2014unlikely. A\u2019s upside aims are served, but stacks aren\u2019t addressed. The trade is value-skewed toward A, so B\u2019s accept chance is overstated. Rationale is brief and not evidence-based.",
