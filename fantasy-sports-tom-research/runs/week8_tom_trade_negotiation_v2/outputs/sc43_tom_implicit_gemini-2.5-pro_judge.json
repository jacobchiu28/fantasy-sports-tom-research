  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s preferences: trading a Tier 1 RB and Tier 2 WR for a Tier 5 rookie RB is a downgrade, not a conservative move toward stability. Claims A is selling a top asset for depth, but A is actually gaining depth. The offer is grossly imbalanced and internally contradictory, making B\u2019s 65% acceptance implausible. Rationale is generic and ignores tiers, roles, and B\u2019s veteran/possession WR preference and risk aversion.",
