  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s win-now, ceiling-chasing mindset and reliance on expert rankings; they won\u2019t part with a Tier 1 workhorse for a Tier 4 WR and an out Tier 5 TE. Probability of acceptance is unrealistically high. Trade also conflicts with Team A\u2019s stated avoidance of injured players (Josh Martin is Questionable). While A truly has TE/WR surplus, the rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s incentives or needs.",
