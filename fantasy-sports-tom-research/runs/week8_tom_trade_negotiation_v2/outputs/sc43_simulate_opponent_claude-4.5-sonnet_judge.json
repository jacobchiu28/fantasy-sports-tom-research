  "justification": "Model notes B likes workhorse RBs but ignores B\u2019s conservatism, consensus-trusting, and existing RB depth (three Tier 1 RBs). Offering a rookie Tier 5 RB from a low-volume offense for B\u2019s Tier 1 veteran WR is value-incoherent. It mislabels Matt Nguyen as a stable possession WR and overlooks A\u2019s stated preference for boom/bust deep threats. Acceptance probability is unrealistically high given the tier gap and B\u2019s tendencies.",
