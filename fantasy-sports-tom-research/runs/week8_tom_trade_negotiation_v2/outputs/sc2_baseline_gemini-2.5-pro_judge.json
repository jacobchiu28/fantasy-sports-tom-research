  "justification": "The proposal focuses on Team A\u2019s needs and largely ignores Team B\u2019s mindset (zero RB, values targets/touches, trusts consensus, prefers high-upside). Asking for a pass-catching TE depth piece that aligns with B\u2019s values in exchange for a low-upside, declining-role RB is unlikely to appeal to B. Calling it an upgrade for A is questionable (Tier 3 TE to Tier 4 TE). Still, the trade is positionally feasible and the rationale is concise though generic.",
