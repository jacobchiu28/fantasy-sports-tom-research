  "justification": "It targets B\u2019s love of rookies by offering a Tier 1 rookie WR, but misreads B\u2019s QB preferences, calling Tyler Miller a ceiling QB despite being a Tier 4 pocket passer. It does contrast A\u2019s need for a steady QB and pass-catching TE, but lacks nuance (no stack creation, downgrades B from Tier 1 to Tier 4 QB). Trade is feasible but strategically shaky for B. Rationale is brief and partly inaccurate.",
