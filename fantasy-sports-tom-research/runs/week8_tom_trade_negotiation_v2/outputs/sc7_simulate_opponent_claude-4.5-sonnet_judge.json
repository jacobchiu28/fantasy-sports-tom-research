  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s need for wins but ignores B\u2019s upside/dual\u2011threat preference and that B already has another Tier 2 dual\u2011threat QB, making Nelson redundant. A is conservative and values possession WRs, so giving up a Tier 2 floor WR to chase a dual\u2011threat QB is misaligned and likely an overpay. Deal is feasible and could stabilize B\u2019s WRs, but the rationale is generic and lacks roster/usage nuance.",
