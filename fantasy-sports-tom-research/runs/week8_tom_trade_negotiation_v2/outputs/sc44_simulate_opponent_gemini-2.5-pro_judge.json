  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they already have two Tier 1 RBs and follow consensus, so swapping a Tier 1 (Kyle Garcia) for a Tier 5 rookie \u201cworkhorse\u201d is unlikely. Ignores B\u2019s conservative, injury-averse profile and preference for stability/consensus value. Trade is value-lopsided toward A and misaligned with A\u2019s own stated preferences (gives up possession WR and workhorse). Rationale is generic, lacks evidence from tiers/roles/volatility or playoff context.",
