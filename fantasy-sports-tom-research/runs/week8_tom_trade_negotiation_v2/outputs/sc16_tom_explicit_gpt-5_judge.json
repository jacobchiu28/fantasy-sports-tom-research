  "justification": "Shows surface-level awareness (B likes steady vets/pocket QBs) but ignores B\u2019s strong preference for workhorse RBs and already having a Tier 1 QB. Calls TE an upgrade when Ryan Turner (T2) > Liam Adams (T4). Depth is redundant at QB/TE and trades away B\u2019s most aligned asset (workhorse RB). Little articulation of A\u2019s motives. Brief rationale with factual mismatch lowers clarity and coherence.",
