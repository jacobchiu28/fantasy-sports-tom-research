  "justification": "Brief rationale ignores Team B\u2019s stated priorities: they value consistent, workhorse-like RBs and urgently need wins; trading away their most stable RB (Sam Lewis) for a committee RB (Liam Carter) plus WR depth may not fit. No mention of B\u2019s TE problem or stack preferences. Offer is feasible and could be value-positive for B, but ToM reasoning is shallow and generic.",
