  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s beliefs and needs: they\u2019re 0-8, value healthy, stable workhorse RBs, yet A asks for B\u2019s RB2 cornerstone (Sam Lewis) and an injured TE while sending a doubtful RB and TE4. It also conflicts with Team A\u2019s injury-averse style by targeting a doubtful TE. Rationale is generic and A-centric, with no discussion of B\u2019s incentives or constraints. Trade is feasible but ill-aligned with both managers\u2019 profiles.",
