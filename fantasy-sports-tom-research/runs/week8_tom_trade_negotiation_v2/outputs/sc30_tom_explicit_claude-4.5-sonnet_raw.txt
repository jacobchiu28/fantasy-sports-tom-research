**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B is 0-8 and desperate for wins NOW. Their manager:
- Trusts expert consensus (likely values proven veterans)
- Needs immediate production, not long-term upside
- Has only ONE RB (Alex Mitchell) vs. six WRs - severe positional imbalance
- Fades run-heavy offenses but still needs RB depth to field a competitive lineup

What B likely wants:
- Immediate-impact RB with consistency (Ethan Campbell: veteran, LOW volatility, FRIENDLY playoff schedule)
- Stable floor players to stop the bleeding
- Fair value that addresses their glaring RB shortage

What B likely perceives as fair:
- Getting a veteran RB with proven floor + a solid WR
- Giving up depth at their stacked WR position and a TE (they have 4 TEs)

Trade construction:
- **Ethan Campbell** (RB, veteran, low volatility, friendly playoffs) solves B's RB crisis with immediate stable production
- **Justin Young** (WR, veteran, mid volatility, deep-threat) adds a reliable WR2/3
- **Michael Roberts** (TE, rookie receiving TE) upgrades A's TE position for playoff push
- **Sean Thompson** (WR, young breakout, friendly schedule) gives A upside depth

Both managers trust consensus, so veteran stability (Campbell) appeals to B's urgency while A gets playoff-schedule upside pieces.
