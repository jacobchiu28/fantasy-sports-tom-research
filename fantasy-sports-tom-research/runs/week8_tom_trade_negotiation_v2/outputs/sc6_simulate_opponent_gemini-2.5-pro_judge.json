  "justification": "The offer overlooks Team B's preference for dual-threat QBs, asking them to give up their only healthy dual-threat (Jones) for a pocket passer despite their need for upside. Adding rookie RB Campbell fits B's rookie/upside bias but RB is already a strength. Calling it a QB upgrade is debatable (both Tier 3; Jones has a declining role). The 0.65 accept probability seems high. Rationale is brief and lacks roster and schedule context.",
