  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s win-now, conservative, volume-focused mindset. Asking them to give up a Tier 1 workhorse RB (Justin Garcia) and a veteran WR for an injured boom/bust WR (Eric Davis) and a volatile Tier 4 RB (David Adams) contradicts their stated preferences. Rationale centers on Team A\u2019s stability needs, not B\u2019s incentives. Trade is technically feasible but unrealistic given B\u2019s priorities; explanation is generic and lacks scenario-grounded reasoning.",
