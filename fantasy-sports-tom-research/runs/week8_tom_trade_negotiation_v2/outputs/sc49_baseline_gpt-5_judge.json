  "justification": "A\u2019s rationale is A-centric and overlooks B\u2019s conservative, win-now priorities. B values targets/touches and stable floors; Noah Brown is their high-target TE, so swapping him for Darian Taylor (more volatile, tougher playoff slate) is a downgrade. Justin Young is a starting-caliber WR; losing him for Brian Harris (committee, not a workhorse) and Austin Wright (replacement-level) doesn\u2019t fit B\u2019s workhorse/volume bias. Trade is feasible roster-wise and returns a TE, but the reasoning is sparse and not grounded in B\u2019s incentives.",
