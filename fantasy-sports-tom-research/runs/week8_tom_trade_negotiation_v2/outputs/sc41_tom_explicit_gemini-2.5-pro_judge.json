  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s TE depth and need for wins, but misreads preferences and assets. Calls Lucas Allen a consistent veteran WR despite being Out/Tier 5, and ignores B\u2019s desire for possession/consistent targets. Brown is a consistent, high-target TE B would value, making them reluctant to move him. A overpays (Tier 1 RB) for a TE despite already having TE depth, undermining internal logic. Rationale is brief and factually shaky.",
