**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B's manager is a contrarian (6-2 record) who values high-upside players and deep threats. They already have Lucas Carter as their dual-threat QB, so Derek White (another dual-threat) has limited appeal as a starter but could be viewed as valuable depth or trade capital. However, as a contrarian, they likely won't be swayed by consensus value alone.

Team B is deep at WR with multiple deep-threat receivers (Jordan Moore, Justin Miller, David Baker, Nick Torres) but thin at RB with only committee backs. They're willing to roster injured players for upside.

The trade offers:
- **Derek White**: Dual-threat QB with friendly playoff schedule - fits B's archetype preference but redundant with Lucas Carter
- **Liam Wright**: Deep-threat WR with friendly playoff schedule - adds depth but B already has this archetype covered

In return, A requests:
- **Noah Carter**: High-volatility RB (young breakout) - the exact high-upside profile both managers favor, but B might view as expendable given RB depth
- **Jordan Moore**: High-volatility deep threat - B's preferred archetype, making this a tough ask

**Why B might accept:** They get QB insurance/flexibility and another deep threat with better playoff schedule. As a contrarian, they might fade Jordan Moore's consensus value.

**Why B might reject:** Giving up their preferred archetype (high-variance deep threat) for redundant QB depth. The contrarian nature means they won't follow "expert consensus" that this is fair value.

Probability: 0.42 - slightly unfavorable due to B's contrarian nature and reluctance to trade away their preferred player types.
