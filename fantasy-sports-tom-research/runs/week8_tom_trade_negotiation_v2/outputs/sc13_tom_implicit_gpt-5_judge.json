  "justification": "Offers B a slot WR and TE, loosely matching B\u2019s consistency/possession lean and TE need, but mislabels Liam Adams as steady despite a declining role and overlooks B\u2019s veteran bias and 8-0 risk profile. Distinguishes A\u2019s upside pursuit from B\u2019s return, yet shallow. The trade is plausible given B\u2019s RB depth and Lewis\u2019s volatility, though playoff/context details are thin. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
