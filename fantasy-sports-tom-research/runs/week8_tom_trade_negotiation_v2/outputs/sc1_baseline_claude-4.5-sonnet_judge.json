  "justification": "Offer asks B to part with a low-volatility RB (Ben King) that fits B\u2019s conservative, floor-focused profile, for two boom/bust rookie WRs\u2014misaligned with B\u2019s stated preferences and consensus. Mislabels King as a workhorse and Baker as a stable TE; Baker doesn\u2019t solve A\u2019s TE need. Rationale centers on A\u2019s upgrade with almost no analysis of B\u2019s incentives. Mechanically feasible, but reasoning is thin and contextually off for B.",
