  "justification": "B highly values young, ascending dual-threat QBs and already has two Tier 1 options; trading Jake Green for a Tier 4 QB plus a Tier 4 WR in a low-volume offense ignores B\u2019s preferences and surplus. A also asks for an injured WR despite A\u2019s injury-averse profile. The offer doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s likely needs (premium WR/RB upgrade) and overestimates acceptance. Rationale is generic and unsupported.",
