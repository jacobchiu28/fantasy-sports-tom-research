Offers a Tier 5 RB from a low-volume offense (which B likely fades) for B\u2019s Tier 1 and Tier 2 WRs\u2014an extreme value gap and a 2-for-1 depth hit B won\u2019t accept while needing wins. Mislabels the asked WRs as \u201cstable\u201d despite mid variance and one declining role. Rationale is too shallow and overlooks roster context and market value; acceptance probability is overstated.",
