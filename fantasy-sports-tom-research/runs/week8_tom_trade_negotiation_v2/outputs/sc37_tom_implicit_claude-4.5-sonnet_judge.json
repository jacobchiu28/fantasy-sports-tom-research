  "justification": "Team B is conservative and values stable volume, especially RBs. Asking for Tier 1 Sean Hernandez while offering a volatile deep-threat WR (Justin Reed, declining role) and a doubtful Tier 3 RB (Mason Robinson) misreads B\u2019s priorities. Lucas Carter is out and expendable for B, and A\u2019s interest in an injured dual-threat fits A, but the return for Sean is inadequate. The rationale is generic and the 0.62 accept probability is unrealistic. Trade value and motivations are not well aligned.",
