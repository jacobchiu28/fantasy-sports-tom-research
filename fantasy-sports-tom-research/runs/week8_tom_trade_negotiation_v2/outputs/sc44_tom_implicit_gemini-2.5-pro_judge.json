  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs and mindset. B is conservative, trusts consensus, and already has two Tier 1 RBs; they\u2019re unlikely to trade a Tier 1 RB plus a Tier 2 WR for a Tier 5 rookie RB. The offer is heavily unbalanced and the 0.65 accept probability is unrealistic. Rationale is generic and ignores roster context, player tiers, and B\u2019s preferences (stability, consensus, injury avoidance). Minimal, superficial perspective-taking.",
