  "justification": "Shows some awareness of B\u2019s desire for consistency by offering a steady QB and a possession-leaning WR, and frames benefits to both sides. However, it ignores B\u2019s existing QB surplus and strength-of-schedule focus (giving up a RB with friendly playoff slate). For A, trading a Tier 1 QB and WR depth for a Tier 5 RB is incoherent given A\u2019s strong RB depth and risk-seeking, ceiling-chasing style. Rationale is terse and misses injury, role, and roster context.",
