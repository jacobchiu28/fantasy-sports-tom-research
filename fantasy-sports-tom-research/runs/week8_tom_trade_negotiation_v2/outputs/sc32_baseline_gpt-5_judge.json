  "justification": "Rationale is A-centric and misreads contexts. It claims a TE upgrade while asking for an Out Tier 3 TE despite A already having a Tier 1 TE and preferring healthy players. It ignores B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs and their consensus-trusting mindset. B is 1-7 and RB-thin; giving up Devon Reed for a second QB (already has a Tier 2) is questionable. Trade is feasible but poorly aligned with B\u2019s incentives.",
