  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s values: they prize floor, SoS, and injured buys. Josh Robinson has friendly playoff schedule and workhorse role; Ben King has a declining role and tough playoffs. Calling Ethan Turner a \u2018low-volatility TE upgrade\u2019 is inaccurate (Tier 4, low consistency) and B already has a healthy Tier 2 TE. Some two-sided framing (RB depth vs workhorse) but shallow. Trade is feasible but poorly aligned with B\u2019s incentives; acceptance probability is overstated.",
