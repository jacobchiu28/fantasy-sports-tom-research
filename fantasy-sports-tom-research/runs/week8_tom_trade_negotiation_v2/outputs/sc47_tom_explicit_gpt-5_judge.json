  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s conservatism and injury aversion but misreads priorities. B trusts consensus and values healthy workhorse RBs; trading a Tier 1 RB (Xavier) for an out RB (Lopez) plus a marginal TE upgrade is implausible. B already has a healthy TE (Cameron Baker), so Turner isn\u2019t a meaningful incentive. The offer is lopsided and the 0.64 accept probability is unrealistic. Rationale is brief and inaccurate (calling the RB swap \u2018lateral\u2019).",
