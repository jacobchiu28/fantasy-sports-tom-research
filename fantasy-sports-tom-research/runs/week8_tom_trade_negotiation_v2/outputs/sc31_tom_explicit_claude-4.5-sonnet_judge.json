  "justification": "Good recognition of B\u2019s upside bias, playoff security, and Foster\u2019s playoff schedule. However, it undervalues B\u2019s RB scarcity (giving up their only RB), misreads TE room (B has a Tier 1 TE, not thin), and overstates QB depth need with a Tier 1 QB already rostered. The offer is therefore misaligned with B\u2019s incentives despite clear two-sided reasoning.",
