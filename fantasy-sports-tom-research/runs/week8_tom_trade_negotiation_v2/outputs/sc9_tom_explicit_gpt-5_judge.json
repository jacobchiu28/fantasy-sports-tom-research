  "justification": "Acknowledges B\u2019s conservative/zero-RB lean and playoff schedule, but misreads needs: trading a Tier 1 workhorse RB for a Tier 4 pocket QB (when B already has a pocket QB) and a deep-threat WR labeled as \u201csteadier\u201d clashes with B\u2019s floor/possession preference and urgent need for wins. The offer doesn\u2019t clearly improve B\u2019s lineup now. Acceptance probability is overstated. Rationale is brief and overlooks roster context and role fits.",
