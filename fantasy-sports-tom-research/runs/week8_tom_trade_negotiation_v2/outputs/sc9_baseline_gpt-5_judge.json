B likely won\u2019t swap a healthy, steady RB (Hernandez, friendly playoffs) for a boom-bust deep-threat WR (Justin Miller) and a questionable, volatile RB (Lucas Thompson). While the value could be plausible, the fit for B\u2019s needs and preferences is poor, and the explanation lacks B-oriented reasoning.",
