  "justification": "B is 3-5 and needs immediate points; giving up a Tier 1 RB with ascending usage for a volatile rookie WR (declining role) and a Tier 4 TE is unlikely. While Foster fits B\u2019s high-upside preference, B already has multiple boom/bust WRs and no TE need (has Tier 2 Brian Hill). The offer ignores RB scarcity and B\u2019s win-now urgency; p_accept 0.6 is unrealistic. A\u2019s side fits their conservative style, but rationale is generic and not scenario-grounded.",
