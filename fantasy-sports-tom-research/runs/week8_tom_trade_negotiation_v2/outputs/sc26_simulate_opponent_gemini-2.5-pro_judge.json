Fails to respect Team A\u2019s conservative, floor-focused style\u2014trading away a Tier 1 workhorse RB and a Tier 1 WR for a doubtful committee RB and a Tier 4 WR is incoherent. Rationale incorrectly labels the return as \u201cstable.\u201d Trade is extremely lopsided; B would accept near-instantly, making the 0.7 probability implausible. Explanation is brief and not evidence-based.",
