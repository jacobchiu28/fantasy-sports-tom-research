  "justification": "Good read on B: contrarian, prefers vets, healthy players, and playoff schedules; QB depth and WR help match B\u2019s needs. Clear that A seeks a young upside RB. Minor flaws: calling Johnson a \u201csafe\u201d start ignores his volatility; rationale doesn\u2019t note A\u2019s risk of trading away their only healthy reliable QB. Overall coherent and plausible for B\u2019s situation.",
