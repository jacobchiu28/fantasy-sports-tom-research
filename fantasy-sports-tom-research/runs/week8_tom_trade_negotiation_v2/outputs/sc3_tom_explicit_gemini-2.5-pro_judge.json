  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s desire for a dual-threat QB and RB depth, but ignores B\u2019s consensus-trusting nature (unlikely to downgrade from a Tier 1 QB) and their playoff/SOS focus. It also contradicts A\u2019s strict injury aversion by targeting Cameron Harris (Questionable) and doesn\u2019t deliver A a workhorse RB. The swap asks B to downgrade at both QB and RB, making the 0.65 accept probability unrealistic. Rationale is terse and lacks specifics on tiers, roles, and injury risk.",
