  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s taste for dual-threat QBs but ignores that B already has a Tier 2 QB and urgently needs TE/WR help, not an Out RB. Team A is injury-averse yet seeks an Out TE and claims a TE hole despite rostering a Tier 1 TE. Rationale is brief and generic, with little nuance about each side\u2019s incentives or constraints. Trade logic is inconsistent with profiles and roster needs.",
