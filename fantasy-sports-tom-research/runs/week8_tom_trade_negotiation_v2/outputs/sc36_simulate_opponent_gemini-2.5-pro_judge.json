  "justification": "It nods to Team B\u2019s ceiling-chasing by offering injured upside pieces, but misses B\u2019s urgent win-now need and reliance on consensus that would price Josh Martin highly. Team A\u2019s injury-avoid stance clashes with targeting a questionable RB. Roster fit is plausible for A, but B losing a Tier 1 workhorse for two uncertain injuries is unlikely, making the 0.65 acceptance optimistic. Rationale is brief and lacks context.",
