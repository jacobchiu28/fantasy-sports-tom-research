  "justification": "Proposal centers on Team A\u2019s needs, not B\u2019s. Team B is conservative, needs wins, and trusts consensus; giving up low-vol Tier 1 RB Kyle Garcia and solid WR Austin Torres for a committee RB (Tier 5) and a higher-variance WR with tough playoff matchups is misaligned. Rationale briefly cites volatility and playoff schedule but doesn\u2019t explain why B would accept or how it helps B\u2019s urgent, floor-first approach. Internally coherent but ToM is weak.",
