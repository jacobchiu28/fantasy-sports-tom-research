  "justification": "Trade ignores B\u2019s stated preferences: injury-cautious, consistency-oriented, valuing workhorse RBs. Offering a Tier 5 QB with variance (Questionable) and a Doubtful committee RB for B\u2019s steady Tier 2 QB (ascending) and low-volatility Tier 2 RB contradicts B\u2019s needs and urgency. Claim that B \u201ckeeps RB depth\u201d is inaccurate. While it mentions A gains floor and a steadier QB, the rationale for B is shallow and misaligned. Overall ToM reasoning is weak.",
