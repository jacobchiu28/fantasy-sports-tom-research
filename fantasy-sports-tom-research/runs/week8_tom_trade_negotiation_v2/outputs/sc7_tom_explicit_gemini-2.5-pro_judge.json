  "justification": "Some ToM shown (B needs wins; playoff schedule noted), but it misreads B\u2019s preference for high-upside/variance by pitching a \u2018stable WR.\u2019 B already has multiple WRs and values big-play profiles, making a possession WR less appealing. A\u2019s benefit is misstated (\u2018consolidates bench depth\u2019 for a 2-for-1). Trade is feasible and could help B\u2019s depth, but the rationale is thin and not well aligned with B\u2019s stated motivations.",
