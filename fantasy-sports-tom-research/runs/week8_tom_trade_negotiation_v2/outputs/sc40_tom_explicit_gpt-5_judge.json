  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s conservative lean and playoff focus but misreads Brandon Martinez as steadier and ignores B\u2019s trust in expert rankings and workhorse RB preference. Austin Martin is a committee RB, unlikely to entice B to downgrade from a Tier 2 WR (Sean Scott) to a Tier 5 WR. TE swap is negligible. Acceptance probability is overly optimistic. Rationale is terse and lacks concrete roster/role/health detail.",
