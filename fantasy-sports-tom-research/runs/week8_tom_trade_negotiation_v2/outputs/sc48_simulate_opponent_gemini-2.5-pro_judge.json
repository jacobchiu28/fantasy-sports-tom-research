  "justification": "Recognizes B likes upside, but mischaracterizes Alex Thompson as a lottery ticket and ignores B\u2019s consensus-driven tendencies and roster needs (TE, WR injuries). Trade contradicts A\u2019s ceiling-chasing by sending a Tier 1 ascending RB plus a volatile WR for a Tier 3 RB, leaving A thin at RB. Rationale is generic and fails to reference player tiers, roles, or health. B would likely snap-accept (probability >0.65), so belief modeling/perspective-taking are shallow.",
