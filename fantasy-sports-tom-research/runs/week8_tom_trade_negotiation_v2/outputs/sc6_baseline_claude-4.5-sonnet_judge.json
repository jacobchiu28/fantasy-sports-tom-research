  "justification": "The rationale is A-centric and ignores B\u2019s stated preference for dual-threat QBs and injury avoidance, offering only a generic \u201csurplus TEs\u201d note. It doesn\u2019t articulate why B would accept downgrading from a dual-threat QB. The offer is internally coherent and implicitly addresses B\u2019s weak TE room, but the explanation lacks scenario-specific reasoning. Low accept probability is reasonable but unexplained.",
