  "justification": "Misreads Team B: they prefer proven veterans and high-powered offenses; Josh Robinson is a rookie in a low-volume offense and not a clear \u2018stud\u2019 (Tier 5). Asking B to give up a stable veteran RB (Ethan Campbell, Tier 3) plus a WR for a riskier back contradicts B\u2019s conservative approach. The rationale is brief and generic, overstates B\u2019s \u2018desire for a workhorse,\u2019 and the acceptance probability seems unrealistic given the value and fit.",
