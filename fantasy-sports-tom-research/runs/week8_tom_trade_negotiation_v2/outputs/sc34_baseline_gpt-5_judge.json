  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s conservative, floor-seeking mindset and urgent need for immediate, stable production. Ben Jackson is a high-variance deep threat and Jordan Walker is doubtful; neither fits B\u2019s preference for safe weekly floors. B also trusts consensus and likely views Josh Flores (Tier 2 RB, friendly playoffs) as too valuable to move. Claim that A won\u2019t hurt starters is dubious since Ben Jackson is likely A\u2019s WR1. Rationale is terse and one-sided.",
