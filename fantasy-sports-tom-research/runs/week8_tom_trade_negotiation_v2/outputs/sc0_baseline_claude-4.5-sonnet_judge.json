  "justification": "Offer ignores Team B\u2019s stated preferences (possession WRs, pocket passers, buying injured, and current TE need). It asks B to give up a stable Tier 1 QB (Reed) for a volatile dual-threat (Tyler Lewis) and a deep-threat WR (Torres) that doesn\u2019t fit B\u2019s conservative profile. Rationale is A-centric and thin. Value is somewhat coherent (T1 QB+T3 WR vs T3 QB+T1 WR), but fit is poor; acceptance probability seems overstated.",
