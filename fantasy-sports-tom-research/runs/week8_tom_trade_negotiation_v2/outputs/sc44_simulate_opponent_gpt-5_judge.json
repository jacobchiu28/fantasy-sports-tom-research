  "justification": "Identifies B\u2019s WR surplus and RB need, but ignores B\u2019s strict injury avoidance (offers Q-tag Liam Green) and preference for workhorse, low-variance players (Austin Wright is a Tier 5 committee RB). Perspective is mostly B-centric without clearly contrasting A\u2019s motives, and the move conflicts with A\u2019s stated preference to buy injured players and value workhorse RBs. Rationale is generic and lacks player-specific evidence or acknowledgment of B\u2019s conservative, consensus-driven mindset.",
