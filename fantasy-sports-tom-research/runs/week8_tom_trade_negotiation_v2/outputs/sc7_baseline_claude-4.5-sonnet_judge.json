  "justification": "Proposal asks B to give up a Tier 2 dual-threat QB and a Tier 1 RB for a Tier 4 WR and Tier 3 RB, ignoring B\u2019s urgent need for wins and preference to keep high-upside, dual-threat QBs. Rationale centers on A\u2019s upgrades with no substantive case for B. While the pieces are valid and B has QB depth, the value gap and misfit with manager profiles (A prefers pocket QBs) make acceptance unlikely and the explanation thin.",
