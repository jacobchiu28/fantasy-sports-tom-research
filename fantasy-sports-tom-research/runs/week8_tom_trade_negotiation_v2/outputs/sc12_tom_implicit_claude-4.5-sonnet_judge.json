  "justification": "It nods to A\u2019s desire for a pocket passer and RB floor, and offers B a dual-threat QB plus an ascending WR. But it ignores B\u2019s critical need for a healthy starting QB (trading away their only one for an Out QB), overestimates B\u2019s acceptance, and has A giving up a Tier 1 low-variance WR that fits A\u2019s floor preference. Rationale is generic and thin.",
