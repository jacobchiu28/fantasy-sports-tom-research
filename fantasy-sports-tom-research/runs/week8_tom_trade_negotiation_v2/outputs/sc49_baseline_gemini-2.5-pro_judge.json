  "justification": "Proposal centers only on Team A\u2019s need and ignores Team B\u2019s mindset. B is conservative, avoids injuries, values targets/touches, and would be trading away its only reliable, high-target TE for a committee RB and an injured, volatile deep-threat WR. TE isn\u2019t clearly A\u2019s biggest need (A already has a Tier 2 TE). The offer could leave B with a positional hole and misaligned player profiles. Explanation is generic and not evidence-based.",
