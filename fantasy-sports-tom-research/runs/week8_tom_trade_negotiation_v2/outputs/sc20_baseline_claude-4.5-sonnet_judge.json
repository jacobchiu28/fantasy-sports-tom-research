  "justification": "Minimal ToM: notes low accept probability but ignores B\u2019s stated preferences. B prefers healthy, young, ascending deep-threats; Austin Williams fits that, so asking for him is misaligned, and offering injured vets (White Q, Adams doubtful) clashes with B\u2019s injury caution. Trade logic is weak: A gives two Tier 2 RBs for a Tier 3 RB and Tier 5 WR, contradicting the \u2018consolidation into higher quality\u2019 rationale and A\u2019s injury aversion (acquiring a Q WR). Explanation is generic and not grounded in roster/context.",
