  "justification": "Correctly targets B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs by offering Tyler Lewis and adds a steady WR. Separates sides by giving A a pocket passer and floor RB, fitting A\u2019s conservative archetype. However, it misreads A\u2019s urgent need to win now (\u201crebuild\u201d) and overpays by moving a Tier 1 WR. It doesn\u2019t leverage B\u2019s IR Tier 1 QB context explicitly, nor A\u2019s WR needs/stack preference. Rationale is brief and lacks roster/usage specifics.",
