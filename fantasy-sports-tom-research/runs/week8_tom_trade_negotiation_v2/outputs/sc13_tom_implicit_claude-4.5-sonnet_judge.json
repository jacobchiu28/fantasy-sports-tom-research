  "justification": "Minimal ToM: treats Josh Robinson as a \u201cconsistent bellcow\u201d without showing B\u2019s view. B prefers proven, consistent vets and possession WRs; offer includes a volatile committee RB and a high-variance young WR. No mention of B\u2019s 8-0 posture, playoff focus, or TE need. Trade is feasible and could appeal as a 2-for-1 depth upgrade, but rationale is thin and misaligned with B\u2019s stated preferences.",
