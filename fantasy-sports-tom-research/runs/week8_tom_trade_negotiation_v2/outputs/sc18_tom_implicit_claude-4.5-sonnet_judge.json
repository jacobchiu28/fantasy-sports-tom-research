  "justification": "Acknowledges A\u2019s desire for a workhorse, but misreads B\u2019s needs: calls it a TE upgrade though B already has a Tier 2 TE, and labels the returns as \u2018consistent floor\u2019 despite volatile/low-usage pieces. Ignores B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and injured buy-lows, though swapping a Tier 5 RB for a Tier 1 RB might appeal to B\u2019s ranking-trust. The rationale is brief and partly inaccurate.",
