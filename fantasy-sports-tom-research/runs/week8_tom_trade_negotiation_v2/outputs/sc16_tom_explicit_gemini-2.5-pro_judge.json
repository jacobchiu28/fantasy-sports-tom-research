  "justification": "Claims B has a TE weakness, but B already has a Tier 2 TE. B values workhorse RBs and consistency; trading away Ryan Taylor (workhorse) for Justin Garcia (committee) plus a questionable WR conflicts with B\u2019s stated preferences and injury caution. Mason Mitchell isn\u2019t a possession WR. The rationale notes byes and volatility and distinguishes A\u2019s ceiling chasing, but misses key B motivations and fit. Overall, low alignment and thin justification.",
