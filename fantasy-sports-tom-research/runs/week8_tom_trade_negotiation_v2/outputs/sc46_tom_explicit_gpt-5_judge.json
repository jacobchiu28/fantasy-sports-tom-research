  "justification": "Good read on Team B: values upside, dual-threat QB, young ascending pieces, and has TE depth (Taylor), making Liam expendable. Offer fits B\u2019s needs (QB, elite WR) and tolerance for minor injury. However, it barely addresses Team A\u2019s aims; no explicit nod to A offloading variance/injury or RB depth needs. Calling Liam a \u201csell high\u201d is questionable given declining role. Overall coherent and plausible, but rationale is thin and slightly imprecise.",
