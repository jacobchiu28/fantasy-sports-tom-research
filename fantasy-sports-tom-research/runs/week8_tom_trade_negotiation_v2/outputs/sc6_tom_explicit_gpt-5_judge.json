  "justification": "Shows some ToM: B\u2019s injury aversion and need for immediate, healthy upside are acknowledged; Jones retained; bye-week cover noted. Also recognizes A\u2019s desire for dual-threat ceiling. However, it ignores that A would be left with no healthy QB (Clark is Out), conflicting with A\u2019s urgent need to win. It also overlooks B\u2019s preference for dual-threat QBs and consensus valuation\u2014package (Tier3 QB, Tier3 RB, Tier5 WR) likely insufficient for a Tier1 asset. Rationale is terse and misses key context.",
