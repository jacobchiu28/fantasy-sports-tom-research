  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s preference for stable floors, offering a low-variance RB. However, it ignores B\u2019s depth at RB, preference for proven veterans/possession WRs, and Adams\u2019s declining role. Labeling Brandon Martinez as a steadier WR is dubious given his Tier 5, mid-variance profile. The reasoning is generic and omits context (tiers, roles, bye impacts, roster needs). Balanced perspective is present but shallow, and the trade\u2019s logic is only moderately coherent.",
