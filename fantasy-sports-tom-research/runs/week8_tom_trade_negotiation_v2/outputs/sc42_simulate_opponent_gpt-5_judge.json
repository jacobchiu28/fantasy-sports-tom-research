  "justification": "It notes B\u2019s desire for consistency and tough TE playoff slate, but ignores B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and caution about injuries. Asking B to trade a healthy veteran TE (Adams) to rely on a questionable TE conflicts with their risk profile. Campbell is a Tier 4 deep-threat, not an ideal fit for B\u2019s target profile. A\u2019s TE need is recognized, but the value and fit for B are weak; acceptance probability is overstated.",
