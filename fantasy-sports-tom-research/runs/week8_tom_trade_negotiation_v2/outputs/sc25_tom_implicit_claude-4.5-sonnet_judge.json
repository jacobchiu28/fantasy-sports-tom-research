  "justification": "Notes B\u2019s zero-RB and youth lean superficially but misapplies it by asking for B\u2019s elite rookie WR/TE (youth they value) and ignores B\u2019s \u2018buy injured\u2019 tendency. Does recognize B might want a dual\u2011threat QB, but misses the Week 10 bye conflict (Jake Green and B\u2019s current QB both on bye). Trade is roughly value-coherent but weakly aligned with B\u2019s incentives and roster shape (TE downgrade, WR strength loss). Rationale is generic and not roster-specific; 0.68 accept feels optimistic.",
