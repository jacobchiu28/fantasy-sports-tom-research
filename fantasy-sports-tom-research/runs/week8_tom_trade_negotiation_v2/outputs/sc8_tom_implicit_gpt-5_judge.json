It ignores B\u2019s workhorse RB preference and injury caution. A is extremely injury-averse yet targets a Questionable WR, conflicting with their profile. The rationale is generic and doesn\u2019t address playoff schedules, depth needs, or ranking-based valuations, reducing ToM quality and coherence.",
