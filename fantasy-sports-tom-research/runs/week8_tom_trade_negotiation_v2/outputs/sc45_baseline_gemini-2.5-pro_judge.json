  "justification": "Proposal ignores Team B\u2019s ceiling-chasing, expert-consensus mindset and their preference for young ascending players with strong playoff schedules\u2014traits Isaiah Thompson has. Offering a Tier 5 workhorse RB for a Tier 2 ascending WR is a value mismatch; no argument why B would part with Isaiah or how it fits B\u2019s roster. P_accept is optimistic; rationale is generic and mislabels Isaiah as a \u201creliable WR1.\u201d",
