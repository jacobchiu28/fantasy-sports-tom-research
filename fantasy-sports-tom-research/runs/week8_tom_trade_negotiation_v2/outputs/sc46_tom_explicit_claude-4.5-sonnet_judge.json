  "justification": "Acknowledges Team B\u2019s interest in dual-threat QBs and young talent, loosely fitting their profile and QB need. However, it ignores B\u2019s RB depth and risk appetite. Mislabels Malik Carter as a workhorse; he\u2019s a Tier 3 committee RB, conflicting with Team A\u2019s preference for true workhorses. Trade is lopsided (A gives a Tier 1 ascending WR plus a QB for a middling RB). Rationale is terse and factually incorrect, lacking detail on roles, tiers, or playoff context.",
