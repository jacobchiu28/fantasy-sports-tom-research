Overlooks that A would have no healthy QB post-trade and requests an injured TE despite A\u2019s injury aversion, mislabeling it as a \u2018consistent\u2019 TE. Value and roster fit are shaky, and reasoning lacks detail on tiers, playoff schedule, and each team\u2019s true needs. Brief and generic.",
