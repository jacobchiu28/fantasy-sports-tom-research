A\u2019s rationale mislabels Lucas Allen (Out, Tier 5, declining) as a steady floor, conflicting with A\u2019s urgent need for wins and floor preference. B already has a TE4; Ethan Turner (TE4, inconsistent) and a Tier 5 RB don\u2019t align with B\u2019s floor/value priorities. The offer is feasible but poorly justified and mismatched to both managers\u2019 stated profiles.",
