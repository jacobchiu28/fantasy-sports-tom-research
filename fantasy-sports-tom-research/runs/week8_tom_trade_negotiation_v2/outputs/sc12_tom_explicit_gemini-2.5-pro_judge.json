  "justification": "Captures basic motives: A wants floor, B can chase ceiling. However, it lacks nuanced modeling of B\u2019s preferences (e.g., dual-threat QB bias, roster depth) and A\u2019s consensus-driven behavior. The offer is inconsistent: A trades a Tier 1 RB plus a Tier 2 WR for B\u2019s Tier 3 \u2018stable\u2019 RB, contradicting A\u2019s reliance on expert rankings/volume. Explanation is terse and not grounded in tiers, roles, or depth; health context is coherent but value logic is weak.",
