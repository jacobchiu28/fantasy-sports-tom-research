  "justification": "Labels Holt as consistent despite deep\u2011threat variance and ignores Team B\u2019s preference for possession WRs and schedule focus. Trade leaves Team A with a Tier 5/Q-tag QB while overpaying for a Tier 5 RB, making value and the 0.62 accept probability dubious. It minimally acknowledges B\u2019s desire for veteran consistency via Chris Reed and separates sides briefly, but rationale is thin and not well tied to roster/context.",
