  "justification": "No evidence of Team B\u2019s preferences or urgency is considered. The proposal centers only on Team A and misreads needs: Team A already has a healthy Tier 1 TE (Adam Wilson), while the target (Marcus Garcia) is a Tier 4, questionable TE. Giving up a Tier 2 ascending WR (Torres) weakens A\u2019s WR corps. Rationale is generic and factually off (\u201cmajor TE weakness,\u201d \u201chigh-usage TE\u201d). Trade is feasible but strategically incoherent.",
