```

**Reasoning about Team B's perspective:**

Team B is 8-0, conservative, and playoff-focused. Their manager:
- Values stable floors over boom/bust (both my offers have mid volatility vs high)
- Trusts expert consensus (would view two young breakout WRs with friendly playoff schedules favorably)
- Follows zero-RB philosophy (willing to trade RB depth for WR upgrades)
- Prioritizes playoff schedule advantages (Brandon Martinez and Isaiah Thompson both have friendly playoff schedules)

Team B has adequate RB depth (4 committee backs) but their WR corps is volatile (Marcus Taylor, Sean Scott, Austin Young all have high variance). They'd perceive this as fair because:
1. They're getting two mid-variance WRs with friendly playoff schedules to stabilize their receiving corps
2. Josh Flores and Austin Torres are both young breakouts they likely value, but as a playoff-bound team, they can afford to trade depth for playoff-optimized starters
3. The trade aligns with their zero-RB philosophy while addressing WR consistency needs

Team A gets RB reinforcements (desperately needed at 2-6) while maintaining deep-threat WR upside through Eric Allen and Darian Robinson.
