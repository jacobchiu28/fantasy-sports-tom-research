  "justification": "Misreads Team B\u2019s needs: they value stable floors and workhorse RBs, not a volatile deep-threat WR; they also don\u2019t need RB depth. Ignores B\u2019s consensus-trusting mindset that would treat an Out Tier-5 QB as expendable. Offer is wildly lopsided (Tier-1 WR + depth RB for injured Tier-5 QB), so B likely accepts more than 0.75. Rationale is generic and inaccurately labels Torres as a stable possession WR.",
