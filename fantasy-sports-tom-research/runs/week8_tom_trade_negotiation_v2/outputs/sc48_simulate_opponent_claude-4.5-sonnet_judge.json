  "justification": "Shows some awareness that Team B chases upside and trusts consensus, but doesn\u2019t engage B\u2019s specific roster needs (TE injury, WR depth concerns) or bye/injury context. Perspective is shallow: little separation of A\u2019s incentives from B\u2019s. The offer is feasible yet misaligned with A\u2019s ceiling/volume priorities (giving up a Tier 1 RB for two Tier 3 pieces) and misses an obvious TE angle for B. Rationale is generic and not evidence-based.",
