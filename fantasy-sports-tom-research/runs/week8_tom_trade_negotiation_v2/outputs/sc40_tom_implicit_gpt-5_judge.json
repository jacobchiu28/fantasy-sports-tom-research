  "justification": "It recognizes B\u2019s desire for stability and playoff schedules, but overlooks that B is 8-0, extremely conservative, and would likely avoid downgrading from their only healthy Tier 2 TE (Brian Hill) to a shaky TE room. The WR swap modestly improves floor, and Austin Martin adds low-volatility depth, but not the workhorse profile B prefers. A\u2019s upside chase with Sean Scott and TE upgrade fits A. The acceptance probability seems overstated.",
