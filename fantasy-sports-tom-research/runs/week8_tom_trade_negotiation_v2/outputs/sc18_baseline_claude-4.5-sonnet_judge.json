  "justification": "Little evidence of B\u2019s beliefs: no mention of B\u2019s conservative, floor-focused style, trust in rankings, or interest in injured discounts. The rationale is A-centric and generic. Calling Robinson an \u201celite workload player\u201d conflicts with his Tier 5 status. Trade is feasible and aligns with A\u2019s preference for a workhorse and moving off injury risk, but it ignores B\u2019s likely preference against volatile assets like Holt/Allen, while Foster\u2019s injury/role volatility undercuts B\u2019s floor goals. Overall ToM reasoning is weak.",
