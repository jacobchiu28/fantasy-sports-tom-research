  "justification": "Fails to model Team B: they value possession WR consistency and Thomas is their only such WR; asking for him conflicts with B\u2019s preferences. Team A trades away both RBs, leaving no starting RBs and violating practical roster needs. It also targets a Questionable player despite A\u2019s strict injury aversion. The \u2018consolidates\u2019 rationale is incorrect and ignores B\u2019s incentives and depth. Explanation is generic and not evidence-based.",
