  "justification": "Asks Team B to surrender exactly what they value (a workhorse RB and vetted WR) for an injured boom/bust WR and a volatile depth RB, despite B\u2019s urgent need for weekly floor. Minimal evidence of modeling B\u2019s contrarian, volume-first mindset. The rationale is generic and contradictory (\u201cGarcia\u2019s workload fits B\u2019s floor needs\u201d while taking Garcia away). Contextually lopsided and misaligned with both teams\u2019 profiles, especially B\u2019s win-now constraint.",
