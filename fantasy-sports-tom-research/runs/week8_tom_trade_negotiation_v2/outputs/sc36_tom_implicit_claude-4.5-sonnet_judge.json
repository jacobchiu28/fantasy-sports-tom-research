  "justification": "It recognizes B\u2019s appetite for upside and injured-buy targets by offering Clark (Out) and Davis (Doubtful), and frames A\u2019s desire for stability. However, it ignores B\u2019s urgent need for immediate points and the high value of a Tier 1 workhorse RB. The trade undervalues Josh Martin, overstates accept probability, and doesn\u2019t address B\u2019s positional needs or timing. Brief rationale lacks roster- and timeline-specific evidence; A\u2019s injury-avoid stance versus acquiring a Questionable RB is also a minor mismatch.",
