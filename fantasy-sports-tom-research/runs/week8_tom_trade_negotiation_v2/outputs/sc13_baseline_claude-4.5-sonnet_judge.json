  "justification": "A\u2019s rationale centers on its own needs and barely models B\u2019s preferences for consistency or veteran reliability. Offering a possession WR loosely fits B\u2019s archetype, but both incoming players carry volatility. Calling Robinson an upgrade is questionable given his Tier 5 status and slow, low-volume offense. The trade is feasible but the reasoning is thin and A-centric; p_accept_B=0.15 shows some awareness but without specific justification from B\u2019s perspective.",
